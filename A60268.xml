         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:58653:3"/>oblidge me thereto; I could, I confeſs, as willingly have laid my <hi>Pen</hi> aſide, as have taken it up. At the firſt glance upon my Antagoniſt's Book, I thought he had ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Authority on his ſide, but upon ſecond (and therefore more mature) thoughts, unravelling his Clew, I found his quotations of Authors in general, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, nothing to the purpoſe in the main, or their ſence perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and wreſted, or their words falſly tranſlated out of the Latin.

            <p> Unto all which ungentile and unſcholar-like uſages, I ſhall only anſwer, by deſiring thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> to conſider, That hereby he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me ſo much the advantage over him, that I could not have wiſhed for more or better; for, firſt, I will remarke that his Morals and his Naturals are much of a ſcantling; and it ſeems probable, that he that taught him Phyſicks, read <hi>Ethicks</hi> to him alſo, and his mind (in which they are implanted) is equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of both; meaſure one by the other, and they differ not a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:58653:4"/>worthy a Reply, not that I want ſufficient Arguments, or a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent teſtimony from others to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my ſelf, and invalidate his unjuſt reproaches, but judge it my concern to imploy my time at an other gueſs rate, then to trifle it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with ſuch impertinencies.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Epiſtle</hi> goes off at the wrong end; it was aim'd at me that ſtood before it, but like a foul Gun it ſtrikes the Diſcharger; Can you <hi>(Reader)</hi> or I now help it? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall prompt thee to carry it with thee to the <hi>Spaw,</hi> for there, both that and the whole Book may be of uſe to thee.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I could have wiſhed he had uſed his ſilence, not for <hi>my</hi> ſake but his own, for then he might have paſſed for a wiſe man, who now hath told you himſelf what he is; and what
<pb facs="tcp:58653:5"/>he contains, let this dragm of his <hi>Ethico-Phyſical</hi> Spirit inform your taſte.</p>
            <p>But I injure my aſſertions, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by Reaſon and Experiments, (if I overween not) truly ſufficient. Therefore, <hi>Reader,</hi> take no notice of immoralities, which, I am ſure, were once no Ingredients amongſt the reſt of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> and their exiſtency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did appear as little as that of Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol; yet (oh the riddle!) I find by experience, after all, that they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for my Antagoniſt firſt diſcovered them there, and of this I yeeld him the glory and tryumph, but whiſper to him, it was his own infuſed addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhall (for the Drinker's ſake) deſire him to throw no more ſuch ſtuff and filth into thoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which God and Nature have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for other purpoſes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58653:5"/>
            <p> Therefore, once for all, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Impartial Reader to determine by the eye of his judgment, which Arrow, of the two, ſtick neareſt the mark levelled at, without taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice which hath the moſt or greateſt Gooſe-feathers in their other ends; and let his Opinion prevail (of us two) who hath wrote moſt truth, and leaſt calumny.</p>
            <p>The method that I have obſerved, is, firſt, to clear up thoſe difficulties, and to anſwer the moſt material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which my <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> urgeth, and that too as they lay in my way, confirming what I have before ſaid, by undeniable demonſtration, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Experiments, adding new Obſervations, <hi>pro re nata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for a further diſcovery of the nature of the other Medicinal Waters at <hi>Knarsbrough;</hi> I have given a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Diſcourſe both of the <hi>Sweet-Spaw,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58653:6"/>and <hi>Sulphur-Water</hi> found there; where I have propounded ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, which not onely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Nature and Eſſence of their conſtitutive Ingredients, but alſo by the ſame may any ſimple Spring-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (plentifully to be found any where) be made an artificial Mineral Water, of the ſame taſte and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thoſe made by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chymiſtry of Nature in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the Earth.</p>
            <p>The Experiments which concern the <hi>Sulphur-Water,</hi> (&amp; by an analogy) all other the like <hi>Sulphur-Springs,</hi> are ſuch as no Author (which I have yet met with, who write upon thoſe Waters) have taken notice of; which may probably yield no very ſmall light for a further advancement of the knowledge of Sulphurous, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mineral Waters.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58653:6"/>
            <p> And becauſe the Eſſence of the <hi>Scarbrough Spaw</hi> conſiſts moſt what of an Aluminous Salt, therefore I judg'd it neceſſary to give an account of the <hi>Alom-Works</hi> at <hi>Whithy,</hi> deſcribing alſo the difference betwixt the natural and the factitious Alom, comprizing the ſum of the whole matter, upon that Subject, in a few ſhort Corolaries.</p>
            <p>When my <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> apprehended that he ran by a wrong byas in his opinion of the exiſtence of Vitriol in the <hi>Scarbrough Spaw,</hi> and that he had ſpent ſo many Pages of his Book to ſo little purpoſe, indeavouring to prove (right or wrong) that to be in the Water, which was ocularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated not to be, even before his own face, and in the preſence of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Phyſitians, Scholars, and other ingenious Gentlemen; and after his laſt refuge to the <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> of Doctor <hi>Tunſtal,</hi> when he had nothing to ſay
<pb facs="tcp:58653:7"/>for himſelf, but that Dr. <hi>Tunſtal</hi> told him that Vitriol was in it, laſt year; was it not a poor (not to ſay childiſh) way of Philoſophyzing, to ground what a man publiſheth to the World upon the bare word (and that but conjectural) of an other man?</p>
            <p>Now when my <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> was thus touched to the quick, he call'd my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Friend (who had made the Experiment before him) aſide, and told him, <hi>That if I would then lay down the Cudgels, he would not only look upon me as a Brother, but alſo, when occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, would ſooner take me into conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then any other.</hi> By which may be concluded one of theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> That either my <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a wrong Character of me in his Book, drawing my portraiture with as rude, as well as unskilfully handled Penſils, or he is willing to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of as a <hi>Bifrons,</hi> or elſe be

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether Vitriol or Iron are two diſtinct Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, or conſtitutive Principles of the</hi> Scarbrough-Spaw?</p>
            <p>Now my Antagoniſt aſſerts, that they are two diſtinct Principles of this <hi>Spaw:</hi> I take it (ſaith he) to be Iron Mineral, with a touch of the Vitriol; or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58653:11"/>if you pleaſe, <hi>ferrum vitriolatum,</hi> or, <hi>vitriolum fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragineum:</hi> this is a natural Vitriol generated in the Veins of the Earth, through which the Spring runs, which hath by its acidity or eſurine Salt actuated the Waters, which thereby is inabled to corrode a Vein of Iron.</p>
            <p>By which, I perceive, he looks upon Vitriol as a ſimple Salt, without any dependance upon any Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Metalline Body: And, as ſuch, hath no relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Iron, being quite another thing, yet calls it <hi>ferrum vitriolatum,</hi> or <hi>vitriolum ferrugineum,</hi> hooking the Iron to partake of the Vitriol, and the Vitriol of the Iron, and yet are two diſtinct things. But, I pray you, will not you allow Vitriol, I mean the natural, to be made of the Principles naturally requiſite for the concretion and conſtitution of that mineral Compage called <hi>Vitriol?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you do, (as of neceſſity you muſt) then if you can demonſtrate, by matter of experiment, any natural Vitriol from which by Art I cannot ſeparate a Mineral or Metalline Body; then will I lay down the Cudgels, yea the whole matter, if you pleaſe, ſhall paſs upon it.</p>

            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58653:11"/>
            <p> From whoſe words, as alſo from an experimental, Suffrage of Truth, it is clearly evident, That all ſorts of Vitriols conſiſt of an acid ſulphureous Salt or Spirit, in whoſe imbraces are alwayes one or other Mineral or Metalline Body couched, which is the main Pillar in the conſtitution of the Concrete of Vitriol, whether of Iron, Copper or Silver.</p>
            <p>For amongſt all kinds of Vitriols, whether Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Artificial, if thereon (diſſolv'd firſt in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) a lixiviate Liquor, or volatile urinous Spirit be poured, it doth certainly (as I have further illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in my <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi>) precipitate the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Metalline Body therein ſecretly contained: And therefore ſuch Vitrioline Waters do alwayes, upon the commixture with their contrary Liquors, become ſo much altered by the loſs of their Mineral Bodies, as they are not afterwards capable of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their Colours, or of becoming an opacous Body of Ink; no nor of miniſtring their wonted helps for the health of Man's Body: to confirm which, we have given many experiments in our late Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>This Vitriol (ſaith my Antagoniſt) is not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to be made by an Eſurine Salt, as to have an Enfurine Salt or Spirit in it ſelf: If ſo, then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe muſt go to the making up the Compages of Vitriol: and this muſt be an embryonative mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sulphur, whether of Iron or Copper; if of Iron, then it makes the <hi>fontes acidi,</hi> or <hi>vitriolin Spaws</hi> frequently to be found in <hi>England, Germany,</hi> and other Countries: And thoſe differ amongſt themſelves according to the diſpoſition of the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Vein, or the different impregnation of the Preterlabent Water, with the eſurine ſulphureous Salt. If of Copper, then it makes the <hi>Vitriolin
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58653:12"/>Veneres,</hi> or Vitriol of Copper; and that whether it be found diſſolv'd in Water, and ſo boyled up by Fire into the conſiſtence of Vitriol, or it be found ſpontaniouſly coagulated within its own Mine, as that called the <hi>Cyprian, Hungarian, Goſlaricke,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet all Artificial Vitriols are made by an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature in the production of the natural, as in thoſe that are made out of Copper, witneſs that which is made by burning of Sulphur upon glowing or melted Copper; from which, with much labour, is prepared a <hi>vitriolin aerngo,</hi> or that which <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> commends as the beſt Artificial Vitriol, being made by a Cementation of Plates of Copper ſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied with common Salt and Sulphur: and others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him perform the ſame by diſtilling often Spirit of Sulphur or Vitriol from Plates of Copper, until they be black and friable, then diſſolv'd in Water, is boyled up, and ſhoots into a blew Vitriol not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the <hi>Cyprian;</hi> So that to the Fabrick of all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triols, whether natural or artificial, is required ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily not only an acid ſulphureous Spirit or Salt, but alſo a Mineral or Metalline Body: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may certainly conclude that natural Vitriol is, <hi>Partus immaturus Sulphuris Embryonati,</hi> and hath its own mineral and metallick Body in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>My Antagoniſt ſhould have given us a definition of his Vitriol in the <hi>Searbrough Spaw.</hi> That we might have known what he had meant thereby: he ſaith indeed, that it is an <hi>Eſurine Salt,</hi> which acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the Waters, (<hi>p.</hi> 6.) which is able to corrode a Vein of Iron; and yet ſaith, (<hi>p.</hi> 5.) That the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol in the <hi>Spaw,</hi> is not made out of Iron. How to reconcile this contradiction I know not, unleſs you mean, by Vitriol, a ſimple Eſurine Salt: And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58653:12"/>then in my judgment you fall far ſhore of expreſſing the true eſſence of Vatriol; which is not Vitriol; but as it hath relation to a Mineral or Metalline Body.</p>

(viz.)</hi> That all the Seeds of Salts are placed in Water, yet are not indued with taſte, unleſs they find agreeable principles of Bodies, and ſutable matrices of the Earth; then, and not till then, they manifeſt their ſaltneſs, and become determined in a ſaline Body; in one place into Allom, in another in Salmarine, in a third in Nitre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which he adds, <hi>Quocir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca notandum, Sal quoddam exiſtere hermaphreditieum metallorum quod defectu nominis eſurinum ſine ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſum re &amp; nomine vocari capit, generale equidem &amp; ad emnia metalla accommodabile, (viz.)</hi> That there is a certain Hermaphroditical Salt of Metals, which for want of an other name, is called an Eſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine or Acid Salt, which is a general ſort of Salt, and accommodated to all Metals: So that you ſee that this Eſurine Salt, while ſuch, is no more than Salt, and not a Vitriol; but if it become a Vitriol, it muſt eſpouſe a Mineral or Metalline Body.</p>
            <p>In as much as <hi>Helmont</hi> further ſaith, <hi>Vitriolum Preſtantiſſimum naturaliter creſcis, fodiris, quibus naturaiſtud Sal Eſurinum poperit, Venam aeris fera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem corrodens, &amp; fontis labentis liquore diſſolutum,</hi> (viz.) That the beſt Vitriol is moſt naturally brought forth in thoſe Mines where Nature bath begot that Eſurine Salt, corroding a ſtrong Vein of Copper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes diſſolv'd in the gliding current of a Spring.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:58653:13"/>
            <p> But do not you obſerve (ſaith my Antag.) that there is a palpable Pouder, which when a little Gall is put into the Water, (<hi>p.</hi> 8, 9.) by which it turns black, (which Colour it takes from the Vitriol) there will ſettle, after ſome hours, upon agitation of the Veſſel, a black Pouder near a dragm in a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, which hath a ſtiptick and drying taſte like <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> and after the ſame manner tingeth the Excrements black.</p>
            <p>Very true, I grant that the diſſolved <hi>minera</hi> of Iron, or an equivalent <hi>minera</hi> of a ſtrong Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is precipitated either by addition of Galls, or by much agitation, eſpecially in Oaken Veſſels, or by long ſtanding, and is that Ingredient in the Water which tingeth the Excrements black. But now look about you; you expreſly ſay, That this precipitated black Pouder hath its colour from the Vitriol, and yet is the Iron Ingredient of the <hi>Spaw;</hi> therefore, according to your own words, it ſhould follow that the Vitriol is yet left behind in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: which if ſo, Why doth it not upon a new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Galls, give freſh tincture? Why is it that upon the precipitation of this <hi>Crocus,</hi> by long car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Water, it will give no more tincture by Galls, as we find by experiment.</p>
            <p>For I obſerve that when the <hi>minera</hi> of Iron is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by precipitation out of the <hi>Spaw</hi> Water, that neither Galls, nor ſolution of Galls, (either of which would have done before) will cauſe any alteration, either of Red, Purple, or Black Colour; which it would certainly do if the Vitriol were there, which (according to your own words) gives the colour. So that of neceſſity, either the Vitriol is not in the Water, or what you ſpeak of it, is not true: chuſe whether you pleaſe <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> you are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58653:13"/>pinch't; and that no Vitriol remains after the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of the <hi>minera</hi> of Iron, is apparent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if you then pour a diſſolved lixiviate Salt thereon, inſtead of precipitating a <hi>terra vitrioli,</hi> (which in all ſolutions of natural Vitriols will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen) you ſhall have nothing but a white troubled milkie Liquor: which will in a little time, let fall the ſeveral contained fabulous Concretions, which had been diſſolved before in the Water, and the Eſurine together, with the Nitrous Salt, (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated the Water, and made it as a <hi>menſtruum</hi>) will be imbrac'd and complicated for the moſt part with the Lixivial Salts, into a kind of <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum:</hi> So that by this it's as plain as the Sun at noon day, that there is an inconſiſtency of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol and Iron, as two diſtinct Ingredients of the <hi>Spaw;</hi> The preſence of which, as two diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive principles thereof, was what I oppoſed with ſufficient grounds, and now farther confirm, which I think may byas any unprejudiced Reader.</p>
            <p>All Authors, (ſaith my Antagoniſt) whether Chymiſts or others, account the Eſurine Spirit, or Juyce of Vitriol, enough to impregnate a Water with an acidity, that ſhall make it corrode other Minerals or Metals by which it paſſeth; So as we may very well lay aſide this Eſurine Salt, or <hi>primum eus ſalium,</hi> as wholly precarious.</p>
            <p>How now <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> do you accuſe me of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, (which I hope e're long I ſhall take of for the moſt part) and yet your ſelf guilty of the ſame, even within the compaſs of half a dozen lines? Can the Eſurine Spirit, or Juyce of Vitriol, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate Water as a <hi>menſtruum,</hi> and yet the ſame thing, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Eſurine Salt (for by Eſurine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Eſurine Salt, or <hi>primum ens ſalium,</hi> the ſame
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58653:14"/>is underſtood) be wholly precarious? how doth this hang together?</p>
            <p>I perceive you have imbib'd but a very ſleight touch of <hi>Helmont,</hi> otherwiſe you would have been better impregnated with his Principles, than to have denyed the ſame thing you had before owned in a very little different expreſſion.</p>
            <p>Do not you frequently mention the Eſurine Salt, <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 17. <hi>(viz.)</hi> That by its Eſurine Salt, (ſpeaking of the <hi>Spaw</hi>) it more freely corrodes the Iron, and that Vitriol hath an Eſurine Salt or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in it ſelf? and yet here you ſay, It may be laid aſide as wholly precarious; this is <hi>quidlibet ex quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet</hi> juſtly retorted. But why do I trouble my ſelf, theſe are only ſudden flaſhes of your <hi>gnis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> ſoon in and ſoon out, apt to lead the timerous and unwary aſide.</p>
            <p>But pray, if Iron be in this <hi>Spaw,</hi> as a diſtinct Ingredient thereof from Vitriol, What is that which is the <hi>menſtruum</hi> in the Water, to diſſolve Iron, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to make it appear in the form of a Liquor?</p>
            <p>I tell you (ſaith he) what will do it, beſides the Alkaheſt of the Chymiſt; Vitriol imbib'd at the firſt, doth by its Eſurine Salt make the Water cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive, and fit to take that or any other Mineral that is in its way: Well, this is a confirmation of your late Contradiction, yet you hover and endeavour to gain the Forts you formerly quitted; for firſt you own an Eſurine Salt, <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6, 7. and then <hi>p.</hi> 11. you lay it aſide as wholly precarious; and here, (<hi>p.</hi> 17.) you very fairly take it up again; and <hi>p.</hi> 96. you ſay, you have with good reaſon exploded <hi>Helmonts primumens.</hi>

            <p> I'le refer you (ſaith my Antagoniſt) to your grand Maſter <hi>Paraceiſus,</hi> where treating of Acid Waters, <hi>Harum ortus eſt (inquit) ex reſolutione Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallorum, antequam ad maturitatem pervenerint:</hi> And preſently after ſaith, <hi>Interdum ex vitriolo &amp; a lumine hujuſmodi aquae promanant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are miſtaken, (Sir) I pretend not to be a Paracelſian in Phyſiology, not much valuing his Theory; your ſelf quote him five times, I may ſay, I think for my once; what I eſteem him for, was his <hi>Medicinal Arcana's;</hi> by which he was enabled to perform great Cures, maugre yours and others malice againſt him, and other ſearchers of Nature. As to that firſt ſentence you urge, if you conſult a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further, you will find he ſaith, <hi>Aurum &amp; plumbum dant dulcedinem, cuprum ferrumque acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem:</hi> Now as for Gold, that will give no Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol; and for Lead, that requires an Acid Salt, either Vegetable or Mineral to make a Saccharine Vitriol thereof; and Copper or Iron, with an additional <hi>Acreal</hi> or Mineral Acid Salt, gives in a Water Spring an acidity; that is in ſhort, makes a Vitriol either of Iron or Copper.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, There are four wayes (ſaith my Antagoniſt, <hi>p.</hi> 21.) whereby Water may imbibe the Nature or Vertue of a Mineral or Metal.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, By receiving its Vapour; thus Water ſtanding ſome while in a Braſs or Iron Veſſel, will taſte of the Braſs or Iron.</p>
            <p>Not to ſay <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that thoſe four wayes of imbibitions you reckon, are pillag'd out of Doctor <hi>French</hi> his Book of <hi>Knarsbrough Spaw,</hi> and out of <hi>Falopius, cap.</hi> 8. without taking notice of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, is a crime you can indulge your ſelf and not another.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:58653:15"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Falopius</hi> tells us in that place, where he ſpeaks of the ſeveral commixtures of Minerals and Metals in Water, <hi>Omnes mixtiones pendent a triplici cauſa, Scilicet a calors, a mora &amp; ab aptitudine materiae ad Eliquationem.</hi> The laſt of which inſinuates an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Solvent, ſolvable or both. <hi>Non ſolum</hi> (he goes on) <hi>telluris ſpecies, ſed &amp; vapores, &amp; ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci, &amp; metalla, in ſubterraneis cavernis reperiuntur,</hi> &amp;c. Amongſt thoſe he calls <hi>ſucci,</hi> he reckons the Mineral Salts; which (as <hi>Baſilius Valentinus,</hi> who was much converſant amongſt Minerals and Metals, ſaith) are the Keys to unlock the Mineral Kingdom, and that whether naturally in the Bowels of the Earth, or artificially upon ſolid Minerals or Metals: and amongſt the <hi>ſuccs</hi> Minerales, <hi>Falopius</hi> reckons the <hi>ſuccus Calcanthi,</hi> which whether ever it fell in his or ſome others way that treat curſorily thereof, to anatomize that Mineral, ſo as to rightly underſtand its conſtitutive Ingredients, may be much ſcrupled.</p>
            <p>But to return to your Vapours, <hi>Falopius</hi> ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 25. That they are all either <hi>maligni</hi> or <hi>benegni;</hi> the malign we will paſs, and come to the benign, for thoſe (if any) I hope, breath upon our Spring; Theſe, he ſaith, are either <hi>bituminous</hi> or <hi>ſulphureous. Ego</hi> (<hi>inquit,</hi> ſpeaking of the Vapours) <hi>non reperi a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liud, non reperiri dico nec ſcriptum nec experientia,</hi> &amp;c. So that although you ſay he uſeth the tearm above forty times in the ſenſe you ſpeak of, even in one leaf ſide, yet do I not find a word in that place, either that Vitriol communicates it ſelf to Water by a Vapour, or that Iron or Braſs will give a Vapour to Water which ſtands therein: And yet you ſay he ſpeaks of Vapours in your ſence; if he do, it is indeed ſo in your ſence, but I know not that it is in any others: And that I may be very
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58653:15"/>brief, I refer the intelligent Reader to compare what I have writ hereof in <hi>p.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. of my <hi>Hydrologia Chymica,</hi> with what my Antagoniſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferts in his three Books, for I love not repetitions: I confeſs he ſaith, <hi>Aqua Calcant hoſa cognoſcitur guſtu &amp; olfactu.</hi> But that thoſe Vitrioline Waters ſhould chiefly (or eminently, as your own words are) partake of Vitriol by its Vapour; is what I do not find him mention, nor do I underſtand. It's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable indeed that there are Vapours, but thoſe ariſe from a fermentation amongſt the Mineral Juyces, and are themſelves ſcarce ſufficient to make up any one Mineral Body, ſo as to become the efficient of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Acid Water or <hi>Spaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, (<hi>p.</hi> 28.) Doth not Iron (in effect urgeth my Antagoniſt) give it ſelf by a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour to the Water? for the Iron that is imbib'd in this Spring, is not a ſolid or compact body of Iron, but like an ordinary Earth impregnate with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete Juyce of Iron.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That though we ſuppoſe Iron in thoſe mineral ſolutions, to be in its juyce or ſucculent parts; yet do not you explain an agent capable of making this Iron ſpend it ſelf in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours? and ſince theſe Vapours muſt either be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal or incorporeal; the laſt, I hope, you will not grant; if therefore they be corporeal, then theſe Vapours muſt of neceſſity have the eſſential parts of Iron in them, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Mercury and the Sulphur proper thereto: If ſo, then what difference is there betwixt theſe Vapours, or minute parts of Iron congregated, and the body of Iron it ſelf? for ſeeing it is (as I further inlarge in my <hi>Hydrolog. Chym.</hi>) the union of the Mercury and Sulphur in various degrees, according to the model of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58653:16"/>Seeds, which gives the eſſence, yea and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Metals amongſt themſelves. Therefore that which muſt be the agent or efficient to make a Metal (<hi>viz.</hi> that hath Metalline Principles, though not throughly maturated) to vapour, muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Fire or Ferments, Salts or Solvents: For in Nature (as far as I can apprehend) there are found no other material Agents than what are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in thoſe four.</p>
            <p>Now it would have very much eſtabliſht your Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of Iron, communicating it ſelf to the <hi>Spaw</hi> by a Vapour; if you had aſſign'd the Agent, by which the Metalline Body ſhould ſpend it ſelf in a Vapour.</p>
            <p>Well, (quoth my Antagoniſt, <hi>p.</hi> 29.) conſult <hi>Kircher,</hi> and he'l tell you that Iron yeelds a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour to the purpoſe, <hi>Obſervantur</hi> (<hi>inquit, Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 219.) <hi>in fornacibus, &amp;c.</hi> To wit, In the Iron works, where it is melted, Vapours ariſe out of the Iron which turn into a downineſs, which cleaves to the Walls and Roofs of the Houſe: He alſo ſaith, That of all Metals, Iron ſends out the moſt foetid ſmell.</p>
            <p>Here is indeed an Agent <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The fire of a Forge, which muſt needs make Iron, as well as all other imperfect Metals, take Wing, and make the next adjacent places their Receivers; the ſame doth Lead, witneſs Potters Houſes, where they calcine their Lead to Pouder, by frequent agitation upon the fire, where the flowers of Lead are ſeen to hang round the Roof; ſo Tin, yea Copper will do the ſame, witneſs the <hi>flos aris</hi> in the melting Forges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what <hi>Aequipolleut</hi> Fire will you ſuppoſe to be near the <hi>Scarbrough Spaw;</hi> Perhaps you may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58653:16"/>think <hi>Vulcau</hi>'s Forge is near hand, and that the Vapours of calcined Iron are driven into this Spring, and ſo are ſomewhat akin to the late Eruptions of Mount <hi>Aetna:</hi> I confeſs indeed that Iron and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not only contract an <hi>Aerugo</hi> by an Acid Salt or Spirit, which floats in the Air, and ſo waſte themſelves away in Vitriols, but alſo are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſame fate of all other mixt Bodies, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to ſuffer ſome parts conſtantly (though inſenſibly) to wind off, and ſo wear away in a tabidneſs inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all Elementary Bodies; while ſome parts, by other active Principles, are wheeled off, and by different Seeds are determined into (and wound on) other bodies; and ſo in a round, in the Metaſtaſis of bodies, from one form into another, through the whole Fabrick of the Creation, and that in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual viciſſitude; and unleſs you will take this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant unhinging the particles of Concretes to be Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, I know not how you can poſſibly make good your aſſertion of the Vapours of Iron communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Spaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do not Metals (ſaith my Antagoniſt) yeeld an <hi>Apporrhea</hi> while they are firm? Have you never ſeen a wiſe man (for you have loſt your ſmell) put a counterfeit Coin to his noſe, and aver that it ſmelt of Copper? The like may be ſaid of Iron and Braſs, and yet you ſay the compact body of Iron will not impart a Vapour to a Liquor; wherein the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries Boys will laugh at you, when we preſcribe Chalybeate Drinks, which is ordinary to Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriack Maladies; the Liquors receive a Vapour from the Iron, and yet the compact body of Iron ſtill remains.</p>
            <p>Metals do indeed yeeld an <hi>Apporrhea</hi> in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence I have lately diſcourſed on, <hi>(viz.)</hi> by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58653:17"/>winding of, or wearing away of the parts of the Bodies, ſome ſooner, ſome later, and that by the efficiency of active principles alwayes in motion, and ſo all bodies are ſubject thereto, more or leſs, and ſo you may as well ſay Gold, Marble, &amp;c. have Vapours; ſeeing theſe alſo eſcape not in ſome meaſure the general mutability of mixt bodies; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides there are many Concretes which have no ſmell, and conſequently no Vapour, (according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the word) and yet are ſubject to the common viciſſitude of Bodies.</p>
            <p>As to the diſcovering of counterfeit Coyn by ſmelling at ones Noſe; in the alleadging of which, I perceive you were not very cautious, for Copper is a Metal that doth eaſily contract an <hi>Aerugo,</hi> or <hi>flos aeris,</hi> by the acid menſtrual Salt in the Air, (which whether the Solution thereof be facilitated by the Conuate Eſurine Salt, (peculiarly natural to Copper or Iron, as Dr. <hi>French</hi> would affirm, is not much neceſſary now to determine) and ſo what taſte or ſmell it hath in coyn'd pieces, or otherwiſe, is to be aſcribed to its Vitriol, and not to the body of Copper: We ſee where ever Copper or Braſs is, whether aloyd with other Metals, (ſo as it out-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions the united Metal) or alone, is very apt (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs conſtantly kept dreſt and clean) to gather greeniſh Ruſt, which is nothing elſe but a Vitriol thereof, and this (and not the Metal ſingly) is that which both gives the taſte and ſmell, both to Liquors that ſtand long, or are boyled in ſuch Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, or to coyn'd pieces: And therefore <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and others, together with your ſelf, not well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this conſiderable circumſtance, might eaſily be deceived, and ſuppoſe the bodies of thoſe two Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, (when it was nothing but the Vitriols thereof)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58653:17"/>to give that taſte &amp; ſmell which is ſometimes found; and therefore the inſtance (my Antagoniſt) then brings to confirm that emiſſion of Vapours from Copper, (<hi>p.</hi> 25.) by putting Carps into a Copper Brewing-Veſſel, with freſh Water, to be preſerv'd for one night, were all found dead in the morning, is, I ſay, invalid; and that firſt, becauſe the Copper Veſſel (for ought you know) had not been uſed lately before, and perhaps was not carefully cleans'd, and thereby might (as we have ſhewed before) eaſily gather a greeniſh ruſtineſs or Vitriol, which by the pouring Water therein, might eaſily diſſolve, and as readily kill the Carps, as if ſo much other natural or artificial Vitriol had been put therein; next to which, the change of the Water, which might very likely have a touch of ſome Salt (that, many times is not eaſily diſcoverable) might prove altogether diſagreeable to the Fiſh. Whether way we take it, you ſee there is no need to aſcribe it, or juſtly think it aſcribable to the Vapours of the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: Which ſuppoſe we ſhould grant, how abſurd and incongruous to our health would it be, to ſup our Broth, eat our Meat, and drink our Drink, ſo conſtantly made ready by thoſe veſſels, whoſe ſteams were able to kill Fiſh? Would it be at all ſafe to prepare our ordinary Food in ſuch Veſſels as have ſuch poyſonous Vapours?</p>
            <p>Yea, and that I might confirm what I ſay by matter of fact, I procured ſeven or eight ſmall Fiſh taken in a Net in <hi>Colder,</hi> which I ordered to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied to my Houſe in ſome of the Water they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in, which with more of the ſame Water I put into a bright clean ſcoured braſs brewing Pan, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And whereas, I ſay, that all compact Metalline Bodies muſt have proper and peculiar Menſtruums to unlock them, if any Medicinal Arcanum be thence expected. My Antagoniſt anſwers, p. 25. Why! I can aſſure him upon tryal, that the filings of Steel (ſuppoſe a pound) ſet to infuſe in a quart o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To which I return, That it is my Antagoniſts hap to be very unfortunate in the propoſal of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, and therefore ſhould not be one intruſted to make thoſe Experiments from whence a well-grounded Hypotheſis of natural Philoſophy ſhould be deduced; for he is unwary, in the due poyſing of thoſe concomitant circumſtances which make Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments critical, and from whoſe management de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the ſucceſsfulneſs, or the contrary, of moſt Experiments. For had he rightly conſidered that all or moſt Spring Waters we meet with, have a ſleight touch of ſome one or other Mineral Salt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Menſtruum, for the tryal of extracting a Vitriolic Salt out of Iron.</p>
            <p>I did indeed try the like Experiment with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58653:18"/>Spring Water which we have by us, poured upon clean filings of Steel, (for that's another circumſtance which unheeded may alſo make his Experiment, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o what is intended, thereby miſcarry) which being decanted (after it had ſtood ſome dayes) and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, gave (as my Antagoniſt ſaith) a greeniſh coloured Salt: which had I not been further inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive in weighing the circumſtances better, I had concluded, with my Antagoniſt, that it had been a ſalt from the Iron: but I conſidered whether or no indeed this Spring Water might not contain in its ſelf this ſort of Salt, which upon tryal (by evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating it away alone in a Jar Glaſs) I found that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſt the very ſame ſort of Salt, and as near as could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore, for further ſatisfaction, I poured ſome diſtilled Water upon filings of Steel; which being bured off, after ſeveral dayes infuſion, found no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>I pray, (ſaith my Antagoniſt, <hi>p.</hi> 35, 36.) Are Iron and Vitriol all one? I think they do as really differ as your Knife and your Ink.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58653:20"/>is ſeparable out of any natural Vitriol, after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Mineral or Metalline parts.</p>
            <p>Yea, I will tell you, <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that if you can produce out of any of the aforeſaid Authors, ſo much experiment as to make evident, by matter of fact, what you would prove; yea, if you can ſhew me from any ingenious Chymical Artiſt (to whom you muſt be beholden, if ever it be done) ſuch a Vitriol either extracted from this <hi>Spaw</hi> or elſewhere, that is ſuch a ſimple Salt as from which I cannot ſeparate a Mineral or Metalline Body; or if you can ſeparate a Vitriol out of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation of the <hi>minera</hi> of Iron, The Game I aſſure you ſhall be upon your ſide.</p>
            <p>For where you inſtance what I ſay <hi>p.</hi> 47. of my <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 105. of your Mamick, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that I arguing againſt Vitriol, as being inconſiſtent with that of Iron in the <hi>Spaw;</hi> the reaſon you bluſht not to urge, why though Vitriol be in the Water, yet it ſhould not vomit, was that we uſed it (ſaid you) in Juleps and Cordials, which doth not cauſe Vomiting; which you confirm and ſay, That the main part of the Vitriol in this Water is the Spirit; which is as much, yea far more diluted with the Water wherein it is, than the force of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol is corrected by the vehement heat of the fire in the diſtilling of the Spirit thereof.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the point, <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> if it were certainly true what you ſay, that the main part of the Vitriol in the Water is the Spirit, then it would without controverſie demonſtrate it ſelf by diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For ſeeing, according to your own ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Vitriol is in Spirits in the Water, and theſe Spirits are alſo very ſubtile, volatile, and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; therefore of neceſſity, upon diſtillation of theſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58653:21"/>Waters freſh from the Spring, theſe Spirits ſhould ariſe firſt; but that they do not, I can aſſure you, by matter of Experiment; for I diſtilled ſome freſh Water from the Fountain in a Glaſs Retort, at <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough,</hi> whoſe joynts was exactly cloſed up; I ſav'd the firſt half ounce, yea and in another diſtillation of freſh Water, the firſt quarter of an ounce of Water which came over, (ſuppoſing that if any volatile, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioline Spirits would come, it would be at the very firſt) whoſe taſte or ſmell did not (I affirm) at all reſemble the Spirits of Vitriol, which according to your Hypotheſis they ſhould have done.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that what had come off at the firſt, had been of the nature of vitrioline Spirits, and had, by the ſharpneſs of their taſte, and ſulphureouſneſs of their odour, demonſtrated themſelves to have been ſuch, (which yet I aſſure you hapned to the contrary) yet would it not thence have followed that theſe had been Vitriol, as you aſſert, for it is (if I miſtake not) beyond the bounds of Art and Nature, to make Vitriol out of theſe Spirits alone; theſe Spirits indeed may (as I have ſometimes ſeen) be coagulated into a ſolid dry Salt; but yet is this Salt as far removed from the Eſſence of Vitriol, as it was, while liquid, and in the form of Spirits; Now that Vitriol ſhould yeeld it ſelf by Spirits, and theſe Spirits impregnate the <hi>Spaw,</hi> and yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the teſt to be found to be no ſuch things, argues a fiction from the beginning to the end.</p>
            <p>But if you further urge and ſay, (as I find you do, <hi>p.</hi> 104.) that theſe Spirits are ſo penetrative, as that they can even paſs through the Glaſs and Lute; then you muſt erect a new Claſſis of Spirits, ſuch as never yet have been found <hi>in rerum naturâ:</hi> For we find that the volatile and moſt ſubtil Spirits of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58653:21"/>Harts-Horn, Urine, Blood; yea, and of <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi> (then which nothing is more penetrative) may be catched in Receivers; (yea, even in ſuch as I us'd for the taking theſe ſuppoſed Spirits of Vitriol) and may be kept a conſiderable time in Vials, cloſe ſtopt, even for a year or more, as I have done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great loſs of their volatile parts.</p>
            <p>Theſe Spirits, I ſay, may be received and kept, and yet are the moſt penetrative of all ſorts of Spirits we meet with in Nature, ſave the <hi>flatus incoercibilis,</hi> or <hi>ſpiritus ſylveſtris,</hi> which is the common ſequel of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations; whether of Minerals, whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the incoercibleneſs of the <hi>pulvis pyrius, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum fulminans,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, and whence all ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous arſenical and malignant damps, or whether of Vegetables, witneſs the <hi>flatus</hi> from the fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all potable Liquors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or laſtly, of Animals, from the ſpurious fermentation of whoſe Juyces, proceed a <hi>flatus incoercibilis,</hi> the very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and agent in Paralytick, Apoplectick, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptick, Aſthmatick, Hyſterick, and other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as you may further ſee in our <hi>Hydrologia Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica.</hi>

            <p> I grant indeed that all Acid Waters are chiefly from Vitriol; but then that Vitriol muſt have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it the mineral compage of Iron or Copper, or what third you pleaſe, yea, and is not factitious neither, but natural; for <hi>Scroderus</hi> (which Author you alſo quote) faith plainly, <hi>Varia ſunt genera Vitrioli, pro naturâ minerae quam in ſe continent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentia,</hi> (as you may ſee, <hi>p.</hi> 4. 14. of his <hi>Pharmach.</hi>) But that <hi>Scarbrough Spaw</hi> Water is as a Vitrioline Acidity, is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> as I ſhall afterwards make more evident.</p>
            <p>Another token of Vitriol, (ſaith he) is that <hi>Apporrhea Mineralis,</hi> or Vitrioline Vapour, which any of an indifferent ſmell may obſerve, which is ſomewhat like that of Ink, though more pure.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> when I was laſt at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> I tryed ſeveral times if I could any way be ſenſible of that Vapour; but neither I, nor two Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans more that were by, could at all perceive it: but perhaps we had by conſent got cold, and were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in our Noſtrils, ſo as we could not as well perceive that <hi>apporrhea</hi> as <hi>Hydroph.</hi> Nor do I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any thing of Vitriol, either as to the Juyce thereof, or <hi>apporrhea;</hi> which afterwards I ſhall make good by ocular demonſtration.</p>
            <p>But looking back <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> to <hi>p.</hi> 13. of your <hi>Mimick,</hi> I eſpie you impeaching me of a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in that I aſſerted, that an aluminous Salt, from a mineral acidity, had diſſolv'd a ſlight touch of the mineral of Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are not here (ſaith <hi>Hydroph.</hi>) two Minerals made, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Iron and Alom by his own confeſſion? To which, I anſwer, that it's graunted. Nay further (ſaith <hi>Hydroph.</hi>) I'le ſee if I cannot find two more, look (<hi>p.</hi> 359.)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58653:22"/>and there he ſaith, upon a further tryal of the <hi>Spaw</hi> Water, he found a body of Vitriol, which he calls <hi>Terra Vitrioli;</hi> then turn over leaf to (<hi>p.</hi> 360.) and he tells you he found Nitre.</p>
            <p>To which I return, That as to that which I call <hi>terra vitrioli,</hi> I underſtand no other then that <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Martis,</hi> or <hi>ramenta ferrea,</hi> or <hi>terra rubrica,</hi> or <hi>minera ferri;</hi> all which are ſynonymous, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame thing, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the mineral or metalline Ingredient diſſolv'd by the Eſurine ſulphureous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Vitrioline <hi>Spaws,</hi> or by the <hi>nitro</hi> aluminous Salt, in <hi>nitro</hi> aluminous <hi>Spaws,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Scarbrough Spaw.</hi> So as you are miſtaken <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> to think that I intend by <hi>terra vitrioli,</hi> any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient then the <hi>minera ferri;</hi> wherefore all right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed, you find me but to number up (beſides the ſeveral fabulous Concretions) three mineral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of that <hi>Spaw (viz.)</hi> Alom, Nitre, and the <hi>ramenta ferrea;</hi> and thoſe are demonſtrably apparent, as elſewhere I may take time further to enlarge upon.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that I may not be long in your debt, but may retaliate <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> I find, as I paſs along, that you ſay, (<hi>p.</hi> 7.) The Iron is not here (ſpeaking of the <hi>Spaw</hi>) a perfect ſolid Metal, but <hi>in ſolutis principiis.</hi> And (<hi>p.</hi> 44.) you ſay, That Iron is here in its body, which being calcin'd, yeelds a <hi>ſcoria</hi> like Iron: And yet you ſay, (<hi>p.</hi> 80.) That the Salt got out of Iron by burning it with a Candle, infuſing it in Water or Wine, this is the Ingredient in our Water.</p>
            <p>How will theſe hang together <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that Iron in the <hi>Spaw</hi> ſhould not be a ſolid Metal, and yet ſhould be here in its body, yea and not in his body? for you ſay, The Salt got out of the Iron,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58653:23"/>(while the Aſtringent <hi>Crocus</hi> remains) is that which opens Obſtructions,<note place="margin">pag. <hi>7.</hi> pag. <hi>44.</hi> pag. <hi>80.</hi>
               </note> and is the Ingredient of our Water; ſo that it's this Salt, (it ſeems, according to thoſe laſt words) and not the body of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, which is the Ingredient of the <hi>Spaw;</hi> which how contradictory they be, let the impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge.</p>
            <p>Alſo, you ſay, in the calcination of the Minerals of the <hi>Spaw,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. <hi>67.</hi>
               </note> That though they calcine whitiſh, yet there are (here and there) <hi>Laminae ferreae,</hi> or flakes of Iron interſperſed, broad and thin like thoſe that fly off from Iron while under the Smith's Hammer; and yet you query, (<hi>p.</hi> 65.) Why we ſhould expect that the Minerals ſhould calcine in <hi>Scorias &amp; Crocos,</hi> ſince we had not here to do with perfect Metals or Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals diſſolv'd in Water? for you acknowledge that there are <hi>Laminae ferreae,</hi> which you expreſly (<hi>p.</hi> 67.) call the <hi>ſcoria</hi> of Iron; and yet you ask, why we ſhould expect theſe Metals or Minerals ſhould calcine <hi>in Scorias &amp; Crocos?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again (<hi>p.</hi> 65.) you inſtance <hi>Snelfer, (viz.)</hi> That the firm Metals being calcin'd with violent fire, (among which he reckons Iron) will not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine into a Pouder, out of which Salt may be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. But <hi>in ſcorias &amp; Crocos convertuntur neuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in cineres quibus verum Sal eliciend.</hi> Thus far you have from <hi>Snelfer;</hi> here you ſtay not, but you borrow anothers Weapons, and forthwith become lyable to have them turn'd upon your ſelf; for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently you paſs into tearms expreſly contradictory to what you bring him in to vindicate. Your words run thus, Now if ſo (quoth <hi>Hydroph.</hi>) why then ſhould theſe men expect that theſe Minerals ſhould
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58653:23"/>calcine <hi>in ſcorias &amp; Crocos.</hi> And (<hi>p.</hi> 67.) ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Iron precipitated, This (ſay you) I calcin'd in a Crucible, in a very ſtrong ſire, and it became of a dark brown colour, and turns to a groſs Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hard as a Cinder, and is no other than the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> of Iron: After calcination, I diſſolv'd and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated it, it afforded a browniſh floſcule, very ſharp and biting upon the tongue.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> pray you obſerve the plainneſs of the contradiction; for firſt you produce <hi>Snelfer,</hi> urging that Iron will not calcine into a Pouder, out of which Salt may be extracted; and yet you ſay, you calcined the precipitated Iron of the <hi>Spaw</hi> with a ſtrong fire, and it turned to a groſs Pouder as hard as a Cinder; out of which, by ſolution and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, you can get a browniſh floſcule, very ſharp and biting; which you confeſs to be a Salt, firſt by ſaying, <hi>p.</hi> 67. that the Water where the ſolution is made, is brackiſh; next to which you expreſly call it a Salt, ſaying, The Liquor will have a ſtrong taſte from the Salt, which opens Obſtructions, and is the Ingredient in our Water: So that being incautious of what you lately urg'd out of this Author, and being byas'd by colateral experiments, you preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly even unwarily fall foul upon the very Author you even now quoted, by contradicting thoſe very words you expos'd for the vindicating your own aſſertions. And whereas you urge the ſame Authors words, <hi>(viz.) Sed in Scorias &amp; Crocos convertuntur;</hi> if you proceed you will find him to continue on with theſe words, <hi>Qui Croci tamen nil niſi Scoriae ſunt, in minutiſſimas atomos converſae, &amp; veluti in terram mortuam inſipidam, è quibus Sal aquâ affuſâ elici nequeat:</hi> For the ſcope of this Author in that place is to anſwer theſe three conſiderable Queries.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:58653:24"/>
            <p> The firſt, <hi>Whether any Metal may be truly calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and brought into real Aſhes, from which a Salt map be extracted?</hi> which in his Diſcourſe he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines in the Negative.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Whether an extraction of the ſame Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar or Salt of Lead,</hi> (<hi>and conſequently of Vitriol,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>be a true extraction, or only a ſolution?</hi> the latter of which he affirms demonſtrably.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt, <hi>Whether this or any other Salt or ſolution may be edulcorated by ſolution, filtration, and evaporation?</hi> which he denies evidently.</p>
            <p>Now as to the firſt, He denies that any Metal may by force of fire be reduced <hi>in Scorias &amp; Crocos, vel Cineres,</hi> from whence any Salt may be extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and yet you ſay, (<hi>Hydroph.</hi> p. 79.) That the deopilative property of Iron lies in a Volatile Salt, with which it abounds; which you ſay you can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and is the Ingredient in the Water; ſo that it ſeems it's the Volatile Salt of Iron, and not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Iron is the Ingredient of the <hi>Spaw.</hi> Surely <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> if there were a Salt in Iron, yea, and that Salt volatile too, (as your own words expreſs) why ſhould not it have taken wing by force of fire at the melting Forge, where the Iron is melted and ſeparated from its droſſie earth; by which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude you were more taken with the nearneſs and novelty of the word Volatile Salt, then with the truth of what ſhould be intimated thereby; but your Tyrociny in theſe abſtruſe ſtudies plead your excuſe; yea, the rawneſs, or rather lightneſs of your experiment, (<hi>p.</hi> 80.) doth upon that account call for ſome more grains of allowance, where you ſay, That if filings of Iron and Steel be caſt into a flame of a Candle, that they burn like Salt-Peter or Roſin, which you ſuppoſe to happen from thevola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58653:24"/>Salt, as if that gave the flamability; whereas amongſt the whole Claſſis of ſimple volatile Salts, there are none found to be flamable; ſimple, I ſaid, becauſe in the complication of theſe, with other vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Spirits, ſomewhat ſulphurous may ariſe, as that of the <hi>Offa</hi> made with other volatile Spirits of Urine, &amp;c. with Spirit of Wine; for it is the eſſential property of ſulphureous Spirits or Bodies to take flame and burn, but not of volatile Salts; and that it is ſo, appears further, in that we have ſometime extracted out of Iron, Aqua Fortis, or Spirit of Vitriol, a combuſtable Sulphur.</p>
            <p>But to paſs to your third Argument, Why Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol (as you ſay) muſt be in the <hi>Spaw,</hi> and that is by reaſon of the deep tincture that the Water takes from the Gall, more then any other you have ſeen or read of, which cannot (you ſay) come from the Alom.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That if we can demonſtrate by matter of fact that Alom will give this tincture, and that whether calcin'd or crude, then muſt this your great Argument fall; but both my ſelf, and my ingenious Friend, have demonſtrated before you and the Gentlemen at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> at ſeveral times, that both will readily give a Purple tincture (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolv'd in freſh Water) with the addition of Gall; yea, and will both undergoe the ſame muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of colour with that of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the like Spirits and Liquors; as I have in my Book already, and I may afterwards take occaſion further to illuſtrate.</p>
            <p>Your laſt Argument is aſſumed from a vitrioline Salt which (you ſay) ſweats out of the Cliff, of a dark yellow colour, very ſharp to the taſte, even far beyond Nitre or Alom. My anſwer is, That
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58653:25"/>you have no ground to ſuſpect that dark yellow co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Salt to be Vitriol, ſeeing there are no vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oline Marcaſities to be found all along that Cliff, where that Earth or Salt is found; for I have with much diligence ſearched the Bank, but could find no vitrioline Stones at all: And ſeeing (as you may further ſee in our <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi>) that all Salts reſide in their own proper and peculiar mineral Beds, <hi>Urpote in toris ſuis mineralibus;</hi> Therefore where Vitriol Stones are found, Vitriol is made: And where the Alom Glebe is found, Alom is made. Now where both Minerals are found, there is both Vitriol and Alom; as I have ſometimes ſeen in a parcel of common Vitriol, where the natural Alom hath alſo been intermixed, being ſhot forth in white Chryſtals amongſt the green Cubick Chryſtals of the Vitriol. So that Vitriol is never made out of the Alom Stone, nor Alom out of the Vitriol Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſite, but each are got diſtinctly out of their own Mineral Glebes; otherwiſe the Vitriol and Alom workers would be groſly miſtaken, <hi>(viz.)</hi> if the Alom-worker ſhould out of Alom Stones make Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, and the Vitriol-worker out of Vitriol Stones ſhould make Alom. Beſides, a ſolution of this yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Earth or Salt will by Filtration and Evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, perfectly become a mineral aluminous Salt, as you may ſee in my <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi> which yellow Salt will alſo undergoe all the mutations of colours equally with the <hi>Spaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what you ſay, (<hi>Hydroph. p.</hi> 45.) That the Cliff out of which this Spring flowe, 's plainly Iron, is ſurely a very groſs miſtake; for all along that Bank, yea even over the head of the Spring it ſelf, is moſt-what Alom Stone, as is obvious to all that ſee it; and as to what you ſay, that though at firſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58653:25"/>when it falls, it be like ordinary Earth, yet at length by the weather it becomes hard as Iron, and heavy, and is fuſible in the fire: I muſt tell you, that what is fallen down, and you denote to be Iron Stone, is not one of the hundreth, nay (I may ſay) ſcarce one of the five hundreth part, either Iron or Iron Stone, for we had much adoe amongſt it all to procure a few pieces even of that Stone which may (at the beſt) be ſuſpected to be Iron Stone; for indeed thoſe heaps are moſt what nothing elſe but a farraginous mixture of many ſorts of Stones, Sand, Earth, &amp;c. fallen off from the Bank, and cruſted together with the beating of the Sea, and ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Salt of the Sea and Weather, into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed heaps. Thus far reacheth your firſt way or manner of Waters being impregnated with Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals <hi>(viz.)</hi> by taking in their Vapours.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, when ſome of their Juyce is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in the Water, and that whilſt the Minerals are <hi>in ſolutis principiis;</hi> to which as before, ſo now we aſſent.</p>
            <p>But as to the third way,<note place="margin">Corroſion of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Minerals, <hi>pag. 46.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>(viz.)</hi> By corroſion of the ſubſtances of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and that by the help of the Concrete Juyces, which extract and corrode Mineral Subſtances; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm which <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> you tell us that the Concrete Juyce of Vitriol, which is of a corroſive property, being imbibed in a Spring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will corrode other Minerals or Metals, (ſo ſaith <hi>Helmont</hi> in the place before cited) that it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through as Iron and Alom.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which, I ſhall refer the judicious Reader, to what I object againſt this (in <hi>p.</hi> 12, 13. of my <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi>) where ſuppoſing (in favour
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58653:26"/>to his Doctrine) a Juyce of Vitriol to be in the Water; yet how improper a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> would it be for extracting or corroding Mineral Subſtances, ſeeing that the Eſurine or Sulphureous Salt or Spirit had already coagulated it ſelf upon a mineral or metalline body, thereby to make up a Vitriol, which we have ſhewed before, muſt neceſſarily have thoſe eſſential principles to concur to this conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So that if the Eſurine Spirit in Vitriol muſt become a <hi>menſtruum</hi> to extract or corrode any other Minerals, it muſt firſt depoſite that body it hath already diſſolv'd: And therefore we ſee that if a ſtrong ſolution of Vitriol be boyl'd a long time in an Iron Pot, (which according to your opinion, <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> muſt needs make a conſiderable corroſion thereof) that no more of the Iron Veſſel is diſſolv'd, then is precipitated of the innate cuprous body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the Vitriol, which we find tingeth the ſuperficies thereof. Nay, if I affirm to you, (I ſhall not ſay more then I can prove) That Vitriol, whether <hi>in fieri,</hi> or <hi>in facto eſſe,</hi> cannot become a <hi>menſtruum</hi> for mineral bodies, nor menſtrual apperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents for the humane body, till it lay aſide its firſt diſſoluable, whether it be Copper, Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to mineral bodies, it's evident, that after the eſurine or ſulphureous acid Spirit hath once prey'd upon, and coagulated it ſelf upon any mineral or metalline body, it ceaſeth to act upon any other, till it be looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the firſt, and then it's at liberty to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to another, otherwiſe bodies would be ſolvents for bodies; whereas it is that Salts are the proper <hi>menſtruums</hi> and apperients for bodies; and as to humane bodies, we ſee that if thoſe uſually prepared Salts of Vitriol, or <hi>vitriolum album,</hi> be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, act not ſuddenly as apperients; becauſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58653:26"/>having in them a colcotarine body, makes them hoſtile to the ferment of the ſtomach, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently throws them up again by Vomis, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the main reaſon why Vitrioline Vomits are the moſt ſudden in their operation; for if they ſhould ſtay ſo long (as ſometimes they do) in the ſtomach and inteſtines, till the metalline or mineral body be by the diluting moiſture precipitated, then they ceaſe to act as Emeticks, and only in part paſs away by Stool; while the Salt which was the <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> in thoſe ſorts of Salts called <hi>Gilla Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſti,</hi> or <hi>Vitriolum Album,</hi> becomes ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and proves an apperient of (otherwiſe) obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Obſtructions; and that theſe Salts of Vitriol ſo called, as alſo the white Vitriol, have in them a metalline body, is apparent, by calcining even theſe Salts: yea, the <hi>Vitriolum Album,</hi> though exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely depurated by frequent Solution, Filtration and Diſtillation, or Evaporation, (as I have often done) will with no very ſtrong fire calcine red; from whence by ſolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more of a mineral body may by art be ſeparated.</p>
            <p>Thus far you ſee <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that though we ſhould grant a Vitrioline Juyce to be an Ingredient of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> yet can it not be a competent <hi>menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> to corrode or extract other mineral bodies, and that for Reaſons before alleadged; yea, and that notwithſtanding what you quote out of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s fourth <hi>Paradox,</hi> where he ſaith, That that which is volatile <hi>(viz.)</hi> a Spirit, whether it be concrete or liquid, may corrode other mineral bodies. Pray take in the whole Sentence, and it runs thus, <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra non corrodunt corpora; quatenus talia neque fixa in invicem agunt: ſed duntaxat quatenus alterum co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum velatile eſt, id eſt ſpiritus, ſive is concret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>He tells you that the natural Vitriol of Iron, is made by an Eſurine Salt of an embryonative Sulphur corroding a Vein of Iron; in which act of Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there happens a kind of ſolution of the Vein, and a coagulation or fixation of the Volatile Salt: Which Salt, ſaith he, as long as it is Volatile, may be reckoned amongſt Spirits: This Spirit (and not bodies one upon another) is this agent (and that whether it be concrete or liquid) that may diſſolve bodies. Here <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> take notice, that he doth not mean, nor ſay, that either Vitriol or the Juyce of Vitriol is this Spirit which corrodes bodies, but it is the Eſurine Salt, whether concrete or liquid, <hi>(viz.)</hi> whether in the form of a Salt or Liquor, which proves the <hi>menſtruum</hi> in mineral ſolutions. So that it's plain that either you underſtand not this Author, (quoting him, becauſe a Chymiſt, right or wrong) or elſe you deſignedly wreſt his words from his own, to ſpeak your ſence.

               </note>

            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:58653:27"/>
            <p> As to the fourth and laſt way, how the nature and vertue of Minerals and Metals do impregnate Waters, which is by confuſion; I might juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it as not worthy further ſcanning, but that I find you bringing in an inſtance, how you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your mixture by confuſion, (a tearm I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs big enough to cauſe a jangle) and that is, that a Mineral that is diſſoluable in Water, as Vitriol, Nitre, or Salt, may be ſo fully taken into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as that the Water and Mineral are confuſedly joyned together; every drop of the Water having ſomething of Mineral Particles, and every particle of them mixed with the Water.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that if ſo you expound your mixture by confuſion, as when Vitriol and Salts, as Nitre, <hi>Sal marine,</hi> &amp;c. are diſſolv'd in Water, I pray you then what mean you by regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or uniform mixtures of bodies? how differs this from the mixture of Juyces of Minerals, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, of the Juyce of Vitriol (according to your own judgment) in Water? either this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed mixture is the ſame with that of the Juyce (as you ſpeak) of Minerals, or not? if the ſame, then it is confuſion without jeſting, a multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Entities (at leaſt the <hi>Entia rationis</hi>) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe: if it be not the ſame, then you ſhould have done well to have ſhewn us the difference, and ſo put the matter beyond diſpute; as you lay it down, I ſee no ground of diſtinction at all: for you ſay, Every drop of the Water, hath ſomething of the Mineral Particles, and every Particle of them is mixed with the Water; that is in ſhort, they are mixed <hi>per minima:</hi> How theſe ſhould be confus'd, and yet different from the mixture of the ſucculent parts of Minerals in Water, is (I confeſs) beyond

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſtency of Vitriol in the <hi>Spaw,</hi> and at which you
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58653:28"/>level your battering force, is no leſs then what is confirmed by Autopſy; and that is, that my inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Friend, the Chymical Apothecary at <hi>York,</hi> took ſome of the mineral Ingredients of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> which remain'd after the evaporation of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he had from your ſelf; thoſe he calcin'd in a Crucible for the ſpace of three hours; and all this while, without the leaſt appearance of any red colour, or the leaſt foot-ſteps of either Colcothar of Vitriol, or Crocus of Iron. Now for certain, if there had been any thing of Vitriol or Iron in it, the diſcovery would have been made, and it forced to confeſs its nature, in its yellow, red, or purple colour, by ſo great a ſtreſs of fire.</p>
            <p>Now (ſaith <hi>Hydroph.</hi>) if I prove that Vitriol will calcine white, then his Argument is invalid; and this I ſhall do both by the heat of the fire, as alſo of the Sun. Firſt, By the heat of the fire, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that of <hi>Swelfer, Vitrioli veneris pulveriſati, &amp; ad albedinem parumper calcinati.</hi> Secondly, It will calcine white by the heat of the Sun, witneſs the making of the Sympathetical Pouder out of Roman Vitriol calcin'd white by the Sun.</p>
            <p>To which <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> I anſwer, That had you been ſo throughly verſt in the Chymical Art as you pretend, you had not ſet your Guns ſo furiouſly to work to ſo little purpoſe: That Vitriol ſhould by a gentle heat of fire be ſo altered, as to be dryed to a white colour, is a thing I deny not; but that this alteration to a white colour, ſhould be the effect of calcination, is a thing I cannot admit: For if after your ſuppoſed Calcination, you ſuffer your white Pouder to be diſſolv'd, filtred and evaporated, you will find it appear Vitriol again as green as at the firſt, which it would not do, if it had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58653:29"/>a thorough calcination; ſo that your great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake depends upon your ſuppoſing that whiteneſs to proceed from a calcination, when indeed it is onely an exiccation, and no more but a degree to calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>parumper calcinati,</hi> as you inſtance out of <hi>Swelfer:</hi> For the ſame degree of heat which will blanch Vitriol, is even requiſite for the exiccation of Plants, to make them quickly pulveriſable.</p>
            <p>And as to your ſecond Argument from the calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Vitriol white by the heat of the Sun, drawn from the calcining Roman Vitriol white by the Sun for the Sympathetick Pouder. The return is the ſame as before, being onely an exiccation of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous moiſture of the Vitriol, and that done by a degree of heat from the Sun equivalent to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iccation performed by the fire upon the ſame ſubject matter.</p>
            <p>Now me thinks <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> you have not laid your Argument diametrically againſt our Autop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Experiment; for in ours the calcination was truly performed, being urg'd by force of fire in a Crucible; yours is but a ſlight exiccation: Now if you had proved that Vitriol by a ſtrong calcination in the fire would have become white and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo, you had followed your Argument cloſely. But this contradicts matter of fact, eaſily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by any perſon who was willing to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the truth thereof, in as much as Vitriol in a gentle degree of heat, whether of fire or the Sun, by an exiccation of the redundant moiſture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes white; after which if the fire be increaſed, it turns yellow, then calcines red, and laſtly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, driving away thereby the menſtrual Salt, which had incorporated it ſelf with the metallick body.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:58653:29"/>
            <p> Now to prove, that theſe Minerals, upon their diſſolution in this Water-Spring, muſt neceſſarily depoſite what other colour they had, you quote <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Videtis metalla &amp; mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralia ſimilitudinem nulla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habere cum corporibus illis, ex quibus generata ſunt:</hi> In the engliſhing of which, I perceive you ſoyſt in two or three words of your own: to make him the better to ſpeak your ſence, you tranſlate the words thus, (to wit) you ſee that Metals and Minerals (diſſolv'd in Water) have no reſemblance with thoſe bodies out of which they are generated: thoſe words (diſſolv'd in Water) I find not in the Author. But <hi>Paracelſus</hi> explains more fully what he means, even in his very follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, which you leave out, <hi>(viz.) Haec enim aqua ſunt, cujus ſimilitudinem metalla non exhibent, ſicut autem metallum aqua fuit, ſic viſiſſim aqua fit lignum, fit gramen,</hi> &amp;c. Here <hi>Paracelſus</hi> is (as by the ſcope of his words may be diſcerned) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of the diſſimilitude of bodies amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though from the ſame ſubject matter, and therefore urgeth that Metals and Minerals, though originally from Water; yet (while ſuch) bear a diſſimilitude to their firſt ſubject matter, Water, for that Water which was the material principle of thoſe bodies, by the ſuperinduction of metalline and mineral Seeds, was before the determination thereof by ſuch a Seed, as equally alterable into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother body, as (for inſtance) of Trees, or Graſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as into that of metalline or mineral bodies: And this is the genuine ſence of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in that place, which yet he further illuſtrates by that next inſtance you quote, <hi>Videtis vitriolum aliud viride,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>id ſi in aquam reſolvatur, colorem omnem depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit:</hi> where again, in your tranſlation thereof, you

               </gap> thus, <hi>(viz.)</hi> You ſee one ſort of Vitriol is green, another blew, but if it be reſolv'd in Spring Water, it layes down all its colour; how <hi>(id <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Now as in the former inſtance <hi>Paracelſus</hi> urged, That Metals and Minerals have their original from Water, to which (whilſt ſuch bodies) they carry no reſemblance. So in this latter Example he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that Minerals (for inſtance Vitriol) may be reſolved again into Water, and then they looſe their colour; yea, other properties which (otherwiſe whilſt mineral bodies) are eſſential to them; and that it was ſo, I may <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> take leave to tell you, that both <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi> could by their Liquor Alkaheſt reduce mineral and metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line bodies into ſimple Water; to confirm which, you have inſtances enough in my <hi>Hydrolog. Chym.</hi> In the third inſtance out of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> you are as much (if not more) beſides the cuſhion, as in the two former, it runs thus, <hi>Similiter &amp; auri colur flavus eſt, qui tamen in tranſmutatione fit purpureus, ſi per tranſmutationem hanc reſolvatur, tunc aquam nullam tingit amplius nec colorem in ſe continet.</hi> You may remember <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that at our laſt Diſcourſe before the Gentlemen at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> I preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed you to ſignifie what you meant by that inſtance, and why you brought it in: you replyed very
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58653:30"/>gravely, after a little pauſe, let <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſpeak for himſelf. A fair return, <hi>Paracelſus</hi> muſt ſpeak for himſelf, truly ſo he doth, and properly enough, for ought I know, as to what he is there treating of. But indeed <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> either he or ſome elſe ought to have ſpoken for you, ſeeing you had ſo little to ſay for your ſelf why you forced an Author to ſpeak in your ſence, when you your ſelf did not know, nor could give any account of your reaſon of tranſcribing that Sentence out of <hi>Paracelſus.</hi> For firſt, you make your additions in the tranſlation thereof, the better to colour your pretence, though without reaſon; you tranſlate it thus, <hi>(viz.)</hi> In like manner, though the colour of Gold be yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and in tranſmutation it become purple, yet if it be reſolved by this tranſmutation, that is, in Spring Water, it tinges the Water no more, nor does it keep its own colour. Your addition, (to wit) that is, in Spring Watet, is a ſeeming interpretation; whereas indeed <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſpeaks nothing at all in that place of Spring Water, I ſay, beſides your own figmental additions to, and half conſtructions of this quotation out of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> you do not (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding) make it fadge to your purpoſe: For what <hi>Paracelſus</hi> meant by tranſmutation, (by que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with you) I found you knew not; and what his reſolution of Gold by this tranſmution was, you did as little underſtand. But that I may give you a little help to what you might poſſibly mean (even at the beſt) for your purpoſe: We will ſuppoſe that you imagin'd Gold diſſolv'd in <hi>Aquâ Regiâ,</hi> of what ſort ſoever; and that after precipitation with <hi>Sal Tartari,</hi> or any <hi>Alkali,</hi> it ſhould come to be purple; which yet it doth not, witneſs the <hi>Aurum Fulminans,</hi> which is yellow; or that by edulcora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58653:31"/>let us ſuppoſe (at the beſt) that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come purple. Now <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> if you could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any ſuch purple coloured Gold, made by what skill or art you can, that would thereby be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Spring Water, and yet would not tinge that Water, nor keep its own colour, <hi>Eris mibi magnut Apollo.</hi> Here perhaps <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> may return, as a <hi>French</hi> Man once did to the learned <hi>Kircher,</hi> who having ſent him a Scrowl of a Character (which he had writ at random) to explain; which when <hi>Kircher</hi> had undertaken, and with a great deal of pains &amp; dexterity of Art (as he thought) had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it, according to the ſence and meaning of the Author, returned him an anſwer to this purpoſe.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Sir, You have explained my Character ſingularly well, for you have interpreted that of which I knew not the meaning my ſelf, having ſcribled it careleſls and at randome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had theſe (ſaith <hi>Hydroph.</hi>) been perfect Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals in their kind, (<hi>viz.</hi> Vitriol and Iron) they might with good reaſon have expected they ſhould have calcin'd of a red or purple colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if the Mineral <hi>(viz.)</hi> Vitriol, or the Iron be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and only <hi>in ſucco primitivo,</hi> no ſuch thing can be expected.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That if one of theſe two, which you call imperfect Minerals, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Iron, may by force of fire be actually brought into the <hi>Scoria</hi> of Iron, which indeed is Iron it ſelf: Then by a parity of reaſon, may we conclude that the other imperfect Minerals, Vitriol (if ſuch there be in the <hi>Spaw</hi>) may by force of fire be brought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the like mutations of colours competible to it as a perfect mineral body: The aſſumption I ſhall
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58653:31"/>prove from your own words, (<hi>p.</hi> 67.) where you ſay, You calcin'd the black Sediment precipitated by the ſtipticity of the Gall, which you call Iron: This you calcin'd in a Crucible in very ſtrong fire, and it became of a dark brown colour, and turn'd to a groſs Pouder hard as a Cinder, and was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (ſaith <hi>Hydroph.</hi>) then the <hi>Scoria</hi> of Iron; and in the ſame page you call them <hi>laminae ferreae,</hi> or flakes of Iron. The conſequence is ſo evident, as needs no further demonſtration; for if the Juyce of one imperfect Mineral, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Iron, becomes by force of fire perfect Iron, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Scoria</hi> of Iron. Then why may not the other imperfect Juyce, <hi>viz.</hi> Vitriol (if ſuch (as I ſaid) there be in this Spring) by the like ſtreſs of fire, be alſo brought to undergo thoſe changes of colour belonging to the actual or perfect (if I may ſo call it) body of Vitriol.</p>
            <p>And as to what you ſeem to ſolve in ſaying, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol is not imbibed in <hi>Scarbrough</hi> Water corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but precolated; we deny it to be there any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way, either in Juyce or by precolation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or imperfect, <hi>in fieri,</hi> or <hi>in facto eſſe,</hi> or what other way you can name; from all which it appears, that if there be Iron in the <hi>Spaw,</hi> there is no Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, becauſe Iron is apparent, but Vitriol not.</p>

               </gap> beſtow a reflection thereon, where the Reader may pleaſe to take notice that ſome Galenical Phyſician
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58653:32"/>do ordinarily, and perhaps no leſs learnedly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Simples, whether Vegetables, Minerals, or Animals, according to the four firſt qualities of heat, cold, dryneſs and moiſture; to each of which they cunningly aſcribe four degrees, whereby they ſtrictly judge of the temperature of the ſimple. Thus they ſay Vitriol is hot, that is, it's heating; Iron is dry, that is, it's drying.</p>
            <p>Now if the temperature of Simples, and their Operation upon the body of man, may be judged according to thoſe four qualities with their degrees: Then might I juſtly query firſt, Why two Plants of the ſame ſuppoſed degree of any the four firſt qualities, are not of the ſame ſignature, taſt, ſmell and operation? Why (for inſtance) the four grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hot Seeds, Cardamoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are reputed hot and dry in the third degree, ſhould not have the ſame figure, taſte and ſmell? Why theſe ſhould not be Emetick or Purgative, as well as Aſarum or Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebor, which are reputed hot and dry in the ſame degree, ſeeing the temperature of them, according to the doctrine of qualities, are the ſame? Why Mandrakes, Hemlock, Henbane, Opium, Solanum, Lethale, ſhould be deadly by being cold in the fourth degree, ſeeing (for inſtance) Opium is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſharp, ulcerating and inflammable? the ſigns of heat, according to the ſame Doctrine; yea, and is alſo eminently Diaphoretick in its Operation, which is irrational to conceive, can proceed from a told quality. Why Tobacco, which is the Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane of Peru, ſhould, according to <hi>Monardus,</hi> be accounted hot and dry in the ſecond degree, and yet hath a benumming and ſtupifying quality, which in it (as well as in the Juyce of Poppy called <hi>Meconium,</hi> or the <hi>Stillitidium</hi> of the ſame wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58653:33"/>heads called <hi>Opium</hi>) proceed from extream cold, as <hi>Gallen</hi> and his followers do opine? Why one and the ſame Plant ſhould in its temperature or Craſes, harbour two ſuch inimical gueſts, as heat and cold, without ſtrugling in the Womb. As to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> make betwixt the temperature of a Concrete, and the property of its whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſeems to me too ſlight to ſolve the difficultie ariſing from this Doctrine: For what's the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of any Plant, but a ſpecifical modification of its ſubſtance? and what is its ſubſtance, as to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities, but a different modification of its par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Well, but to return to Vitriol, which our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſaith is hot, that is, it's heating, yet he tells us not what ſort of Vitriol that is, whether of Iron, of Copper, Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively made evident, that there is no Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol exiſtent in nature, but hath a mineral or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline body, as the main Ingredient of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages: Yea, if we ſhould know which ſort of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol he intended, yet ſhould we be at a loſs to find whether it muſt be the whole compound body of Vitriol, or any of its conſtitutive Ingredients, or any parts ſeparable therefrom by the fire; whether the Colcothar, Eſurine Salt, Spirit, Flegm, Oyl, which is hot, that is, its heating?</p>
            <p>That Iron ſhould be dry, that is, drying; and Vitriol hot, that is, heating, we have no other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then what is purely effeminate <hi>(viz.)</hi> it is ſo, becauſe it is ſo; And what if <hi>Jacobus de Partibut, Kircher, Gallen, Conciliator, Paracelſus,</hi> and a hundred more ſhould ſay ſo?

            <p>But that my Antagoniſt may not appear altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther barren of Experiments, he end eavours to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the opening and drying, the deopilative and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58653:34"/>aſtringent qualities of Iron; the former to lie in a Volatile Salt, the latter in the <hi>Crocus</hi> or terreſtrial part; by this Experiment, of caſting filings of Steel or Iron into the flame of a Candle, and it will burn like Salt-peter or Roſin. Theſe filings, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd three or four times in Water or Wine, (as in making Chalybeat Wines) till the Liquor hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd all the Salt; then dry it, and caſt it into the flame, and it ſhall not burn, but the Liquor ſhall have a ſtrong taſte from the Salt.</p>
            <p>As to the verity in matter of fact of the flagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of filings of Steel caſt upon the flame of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, <hi>Experto Crede Roberto.</hi> But his Philoſophick remarks thereon are indeed remarkable, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That that which gives the flame ſhould be the Volatile Salt of Steel, is no leſs then a miſtake of a Salt for a Sulphur, an incombuſtible for a combuſtible; for no Volatile Salt whatever as ſuch, is inflamable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed the eſſential properties of Sulphurs, whether Vegetable, Animal or Mineral, to take flame and burn; which that it is ſo, is evident both by a flagrable Sulphur, which we have ſeparated from Steel, as alſo by this Experiment, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That if in the making the <hi>Saccharum Martis,</hi> you hold a Candle at the top of the Glaſs, while the Oil of Vitriol is working upon it, you will find that as ſoon as it toucheth the ſteam, which aſcends from the inteſtine conteſt of the two Combatants, it will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately take flame, and burn like as if ſo much Oil or Spirit of Wine had been fired. Now that Iron ſhould (according to the teſtimony of thoſe Authors my Antag.<note place="margin">Two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</note> quotes) be cold and dry, and yet according to his own Experiment ſhould take flame, is ſurely no leſs than a palpable contradiction: for ſulphureous
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58653:35"/>parts are alwayes reputed hot, ſo that an inch breaks no ſquares betwixt his Arguments and Experiments; Yea, that Vitriol which he judgeth hot, that is, heating, ſhould be ſo, and yet the Spirit of Vitriol, (as well as the Spirits thereof in the <hi>Spaw</hi>) which in plain words, (<hi>p.</hi> 97.) he ſaith, are both Vitriol (how true we may elſewhere examine) are uſed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in moſt cooling Juleps, both to cool and quench thirſt in Feavers; that the ſame numerical body of Vitriol ſhould, as ſuch, be both hot &amp; cold, is not a ſleight, but a groſs contradiction, and argues great inconſiſtency and unfaithfulneſs to himſelf.</p>
            <p>From hence to <hi>pag.</hi> 90. is nothing but what al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hath been ſaid, and already may (without further repetition) be reputed ſufficiently anſwered. Here he quotes what I ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 38, 39. of my <hi>Hydrol. Chym. (viz.)</hi>

            <p>My Antagoniſt returns thus, I ſaid indeed (quoth he) and ſo I do confidently ſay ſtill, That it is the Vitriol alone, that being diſſolv'd by its Mineral Juyce in this Water, takes the tincture from the Gall.</p>

            <p> To which I anſwer, That to gainſay confidently, yea to perſiſt in the deny al of what is plainly, even ocularly demonſtrated, becomes not, yea, is below a Philoſopher or lover of Truth.

            <p>After a little bickerings, and ſome experiments I made of the <hi>Spaw</hi> Water, my ingenuous Friend, the Chymical Apothecary, for a through-experiment whether of us was in the right, deſired my Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt to ſhew in what part of the Cliff his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Vitriol lay; who pointing to the place, thruſt in his Knife, and took out ſome of the crude Alom Stone which lay under the Floſcule. That it was Alom Stone my Antagoniſt could not deny; but that it ſhould in freſh Water, with the addition of Gall, give a purple tincture, he utterly denyed; wherefore that they might not be long in ſuſpence whether it was ſo or no, it was concluded that an Experiment thereof ſhould be forthwith made, and that the whole matter ſhould hang thereon, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Whether Vitriol or Alom was the Ingredient in the Water; for it might be eaſily granted, that if Alom did not give the tincture, then it muſt be ſomewhat elſe, and that could be no other than Vitriol; but if that did give the tincture, then it was not from Vitriol, becauſe Alom hath been ſeparated, but never any Vitriol from the Water.</p>
            <p>Therefore taking a Porringer of freſh Water, in which ſome of this crude ſucculent Alom Stone was ſhav'd, with addition of Galls (wherewith my Antag. was well ſtockt) and in the preſence of ſeveral Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, Scholars, and other ingenuous Gentlemen, it preſently ſtruck as deep a tincture as if it had been the <hi>Spaw</hi> Water it ſelf: at which my Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt trembled and grew pale, and in a ſudden paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion told them, That he would take his Oath, that Dr. <hi>Tunſtal</hi> told him that it was Vitriol the laſt year; which with reiteration he averr'd: The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58653:37"/>being by, asked, Where was his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? So with an Apoſiopeſis, they broke up ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly. Thus my Antagoniſt was caſt upon the Sands with a Hurricane or ſudden ſtorm of an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Experiment; Yea, and not only the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent Alom Stone, but even any of the hard Alom Stones (of which that Bank is full) we found would give a tincture in freſh Water, acidulated with Spirit or Oyl of Sulphur, if thereto Galls were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for to make a hard compact mineral Stone to give its tincture in freſh Water, cannot eaſily be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, according to the uniform Laws of Nature, unleſs that Water be firſt made a proper Menſtruum, by acidulating it with a ſingular and mineral Spirit proper for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>So that my Antagoniſt may as equally conclude, that Sulphur has neither tincture nor acidity in it, becauſe being boyled in Spring Water alone, it gives neither, nor doth it yeeld any acidity to the taſte being chewed; and yet let the ſame Water but be acuated with an Alkalie, or let the ſame fixed Salt be melted with the Sulphur, and the body of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur will thereby be ſo opened, as to yeeld both its tincture as red as blood, and odour alſo, which laſt will be made to appear by the addition of any acid Juyce; yea, its acidity will plainly be evident by burning it under a Glaſs Bell, witneſs the Oil of Sulphur made after that manner: ſo that where mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral bodies are to be diſlolv'd or unlock'd, their Menſtruums are to be acuated and duly prepared.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in confirmation of what I elſewhere aſſert in my <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi> concerning an Acid Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Spirit or Salt, which being diſſolv'd in a Water Spring, becomes a ſutable Menſtruum to make Solutions, or to take in the tinctures of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58653:37"/>or Metalline Bodies which lie in their way; I ſay, in confirmation hereof, I find the ingenuous <hi>Swelfer</hi> in his Appendix, (<hi>p.</hi> 97.) ſaith to the very ſame purpoſe, thus, <hi>Etenim vitriolum caerulcum (quod me judice nihil aliud eſt quam cuprum, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doque etiam ex venâ argenteâ ortum ducens in viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus terrae a ſpiritu ſulphuris ſolutum, quemadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum viride vitriolum à venis ferri eſt; eodem ſpiritu ſulphuris in terrae autris diſſolutum) è cupreis venis exortum, &amp;c.</hi> And that this is a ſulphureous Salt or Spirit which acuates the Water of this <hi>Spaw</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible, as well to Alom as Vitriol, is evident, both by the profound <hi>Helmont</hi>'s definition of this Eſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Salt, <hi>(viz.) Eſt partus immaturus ſulphuris embryonati.</hi> As alſo by this experimental Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which confirms both, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That in the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or calcining the Alom Stone, to make it capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to yeeld its imbred Salt, a Sulphur is found thruſt forth to the ſurface of the Stone, by the force of fire, which will take flame at a Candle, and burn with a blew flame, with the ſame ſulphureous ſmell as common Sulphur, which lies in a cruſt driven from the body of the Alom Stone, and adheres to it; of which I have ſome by me, and have tryed the Experiment therewith; by which it appears that that Salt, connatural with the Alom Stone, hath alſo eſpouſed to it ſelf an embryonate Sulphur, which lies dormant in all mineral acid Spirits, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Vitriol or Alom, this not being able to abide the force of fire in the calcination of the Alom Stone, is preſſed forth to the ſuperficies thereof, chiefly at the outſide of the heap, and there appears in the real form of Sulphur, as combuſtible as any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon one.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:58653:38"/>
            <p> Thus the <hi>Legich,</hi> by which I argue from calciu'd Alom Stone, to the crude aluminous Juyce in the Water, is no leſs then by an autoptical induction, as apparent as the Sun at noon day, and no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable, but indeed more obvious, then that three Angles of a Triangle ſhould alwayes be equal to two right Angles; or then that the Angles of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence and reflexion ſhould alwayes be the ſame.</p>
            <p>But that we may be the more certain, whether if there were any ſuch thing as Vitriol in this <hi>Spaw</hi> Water, it might not by tryal be diſcovered; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for better ſatisfaction, made a ſolution, firſt of Vitriol and Nitre in diſtilled Water, mixed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporated them in an eaſie heat of a Sand Furnace, until they did ſhoot in Chryſtals, which were plainly diſtinct each from other, ſo as one might ſee them ſeverally in the bottom of the Glaſs.</p>
            <p>Then I took Vitriol and Alom Salt, (<hi>viz.</hi> the true Alom) of each an anatical proportion, whole Solutions in diſtill'd Water were filtred, mixed and evaporated to Chryſtals, which alſo were diſtinct, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Chryſtals of Vitriol from thoſe of Alom; Then I took the Solutions of Vitriol, Alom and Nitre, of each alike in diſtilled Water, which being filtred, mixed and evaporated, <hi>ad cuticulam,</hi> gave three diſtinct ſorts of Chryſtals, <hi>(viz.)</hi> long ſtyriate, which were of Nitre; white Chryſtals, which were from Alom; and green, which were from Vitriol, every one, in their ſeveral form, diſtinguiſhable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the bare eye.</p>
            <p>But that I might leave no ſtone unmoved that might lie in my way, or upon which my Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt might have the leaſt foundation for his ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hypotheſis of the exiſtency of Vitriol in this <hi>Spaw,</hi> that I might (I ſay) unravel to the very
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58653:38"/>bottom of his Clew, whoſe deepeſt reſerve (and by which he thinks he hits the nail o'th head) is fetche from a ſuppoſition of the preſence of Vitriol in this Water by its Juyce, or <hi>in ſucco primitivo;</hi> I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took ſome of the Marcaſite Stones of Vitriol, which I got out of the black Bog, near the <hi>Sulphur-Well</hi> at <hi>Knarsbrough,</hi> which is the <hi>minera</hi> of Vitriol, in which (if any where) the Vitriol is <hi>in ſucco:</hi> upon this pulveriſed, I poured a Solution of <hi>Sal marine,</hi> and let them ſtand together in a Matraſs for ſeveral dayes; which by ſtanding <hi>in ſtigido,</hi> extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a green tincture from the Marcaſites: This I decanted and filtred, which with the addition of Galls, would ſtrike a tincture not inferiour to the Solution of the body of Vitriol. This yellow green ſalty Liquor I cauſed to be evaporated, in a gentle heat, in a Jar Glace placed in Sand, which ſhot into curious yellow ting'd Chryſtals, which left in the bottom an Oaker, or <hi>Terra Vitriolica;</hi> after the manner as is found upon the like proceſs with other factitious Vitriols.</p>
            <p>That which was very remarkable was, That the yellowiſh Liquor wherein theſe Chryſtals did ſhoot, would not with Galls ſtrike any colour, but remain'd clear as before the addition thereof: but when I added ſome more clear Water, and thereby diluted it, I found that then it gave a purple colour. The very like to which, I obſerved to happen to a ſtrong Solution of <hi>Dantz</hi>-Vitriol, brought to an oyly conſiſtence immediately before ſhooting, which with the addition of Galls I found would give no alteration of colour; but when I diluted it with more Water, it then gave its purple tincture, and that the deeper by how much (to a certain propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the more Water I added; juſt as ſome <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:58653:39"/>may be graduated too highly, and made too ſtrong to corrode or diſſolve their proper bodies; the Solutions of which they cannot perform till they be made weaker. Here if I ſhould tell my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, That I know by a <hi>menſtruum,</hi> (not rare amongſt Chymiſts) with the addition of mine or his breath, how to calcine a Metal, (<hi>viâ humidâ,</hi> as the Chymiſts ſpeak) without which (or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what equivalent thereto) the humid calcination of that Metal cannot be performed, alſo how to melt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Metal (prepared after a certain manner) with the help of one ſingle Lamp, unaſſiſted by any blaſt, he would, without doubt, look upon them as Paradoxes.</p>
            <p>But to confirm yet further the exiſtency and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of Alom in the <hi>Scarbrough</hi> Water; I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that in the very <hi>minera</hi> of that Stone and Earth, found upon the Bank, a thin Scale of a bright Chryſtalline Marcaſite, of the very colour and brightneſs, like another which I do, by an artifice upon that Water, ſeparate therefrom, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a bright clear Talk; yea, I find other gritty parcels of a ſabulous Earth, much-what like the others, ſeparated from the <hi>Spaw</hi> Water by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Artifice.</p>
            <p>Now from a collation of Experiments, theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Corrolaries will naturally reſult.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That a Mineral, in its crude ſucculent parts, may eaſily be diſſolv'd in Spring Water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, when its more compact body, whoſe parts are lockt up more ſtrictly, require a ſulphureous Menſtruum to diſſolve it, or take it in pieces; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the crude ſucculent Alom Stone, readily giving its tincture with Gall in freſh Water, when the hard ſlate thereof requires Water acidulated with is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58653:39"/>ſulphureous Spirit, to open the body thereof, to make it give its vertue.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Marcaſites of Vitriol and Alom, have an embryonative Sulphur connatural with them, produc'd out of the ſame Mineral Seed; for inſtance, the Sulphur cruſt, ſeparated by Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Alom Stone; and in the Vitriol Marcaſites, I find, that putting them into the fire, they burn of a blew flame, and have a ſulphureous ſmell; in both theſe the Sulphur is really anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the common Sulphur or Brimſtone.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That ſeveral Mineral Salts, and other connatural bodies may conſiſt diſguis'd under one liquid Mask; which when taken off by a gentle diſtillation or evaporation, each ſhews it ſelf in its own likeneſs. Thus Alom, Vitriol, and Nitre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolv'd in Water, and ſo mixed together, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a liquid form, with very little diſcriminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but when this Water is taken away by eaſie diſtillation or evaporation; then they appear, <hi>ſtatu quo prius, (viz.)</hi> Alom, Vitriol and Nitre, again, each in their ſeveral ſhapes. Thus the ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Ingredients of the <hi>Scarbrough Spaw</hi> Water, whilſt under that liquid Mask, ſhew as one ſimple limpid tranſparent body, but take off the Mask, (as aforeſaid) and then they appear, each in their own form, ſuch as they were before their Solution in that Spring.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the <hi>minera</hi> or Marcaſites of Alom or Vitriol, do as really give their tinctures, or yeeld their Solutions in Water; yea, do every way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the operations agreeable to what is expected, or may be performed by their factitious bodies: Thus the ſolution of the ſucculent Alom Stone, gives the ſame mutation of colours, as the Liquor drawn
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58653:40"/>from the body of the calcin'd Stone; ſo in like manner doth the ſolution of the Vitriol marcaſite in Water, give the ſame tincture by Galls, as the factitious body of Vitriol doth, yea, and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the ſame Vitriolick Oaker, or yellow Sediment, as the other doth.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That a mineral or metallick ſolution, may have its parts ſo concentred, as it may not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of that alteration of colours, compatible to the ſame ſolution diluted or thin'd. Thus the ſtrong yellowiſh Liquor made from a ſolution of Salt, extracting the tincture from the Marcaſites of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, would not with Galls give any alteration of colour, which yet it would do, when diluted, by adding more Water thereto; and thus a ſtrong ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Vitriol would ſtrike no purple, nor other colour with Gall, when yet the ſame diluted did ſo.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, (ſaith my Antagoniſt) I have tryed it of that ſort of Alom-Mine which is in the Cliff near the Well,<note place="margin">pag. <hi>91.</hi>
               </note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving broken it to Pouder, and infus'd it in Spring Water ſome hours, and it received no tincture from Gall: Nay, I calcin'd that very Stone, and then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd it in Spring Water; and yet it received no tincture from Galls.</p>
            <p>Which how true, I ſhall appeal to thoſe many Gentlemen at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> who ſaw the Experiment ocularly demonſtrated, yea, the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> to whom I ſent up ſo much as was ſufficient to paſs the teſt before them; yea, to thoſe who have ſeen the Experiment tryed at publick places and elſewhere in <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To confirm his Opinion, That Alom Stone gives no tincture, nor yeelds any vertues to Water, my Antagoniſt brings in this inſtance, <hi>p.</hi> 29. <hi>(viz.)</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58653:40"/>That at the Alom Mine at <hi>Whithy,</hi> in the middle thereof a Spring of freſh Water breaks forth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving twelve fathom of Mine about it; which yet gives no tincture with Galls, having taken no vapot, odor, or ſapor from the Mine.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt by obſerving how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent my Antagoniſt is to what he declares, <hi>p.</hi> 16. of his <hi>Mimick,</hi> accounting with <hi>Kircher,</hi> That Spring Water is a proper <hi>menſtruum</hi> to take in the vertues of Minerals and Metals; witneſs that at St. <hi>Lucas</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which hath imbibed Iron and Alom; another in <hi>Germany</hi> impregnated with Alom and Nitre; and yet here denies it either to take va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, odor, or ſapor from the Mine it paſſeth through: Next to which I endeavoured, by climing that ſteep Bank at <hi>Whithy,</hi> to have examined the ſource of that Spring; but having not time, I procured this account thereof from an ingenuous Friend, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That it runs not through the Alom Work, but under the bottom of the ſtony Quarry, full of Cleffs, (about which there are divers Earths about the height of eight or ten yards to the ſurface of the ground) underneath which Quarry is a Mine, in colour much reſembling that of Alom; but is not the ſame in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with it, nor accounted ſo by the Workmen, but is uſually called by them <hi>Doggers,</hi> or <hi>Cats-heads;</hi> betwixt which, and the aboveſaid Quarry, iſſues forth that Spring, and therefore no wonder it partakes of no vertues therefrom; in ſome of theſe <hi>Cats-heads,</hi> being broken, are found in the middle thereof, a kind of tranſparent Talk.</p>
            <p>Thus as he concludes,<note place="margin">pag. <hi>93.</hi>
               </note> Alom Stone to give neither vapor, odor, or ſapor to ſpring Water, (which how true let the World judge.) So he further proceeds to tell us, That neither doth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58653:41"/>Iron give any tincture in Spring Water with Gall, nor yeeld any Sediment upon evaporation; witneſs the Spring of freſh Water which runs out of an Iron Mine near <hi>Barnſley,</hi> upon the edge of <hi>Derbyſhire;</hi> the which my Antagoniſt contradicts, by cloſing with what he relates out of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> by which he hints (in his own words) as if ſimple Water alone were ſufficient to imbibe a Metal, (as Iron) while it hath not attained its perfection; which in truth is the caſe of the Iron Mine at <hi>Scarbrough,</hi> and yet here (according to him) it neither gives tincture with Gall, nor yeelds any Sediment; but this alſo contradicts his Experiment of a Vitrioline Salt made out of Iron by an infuſion in Water.</p>

            <head>A brief Account of the <hi>Anom-Works At WHITBY.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>NOW, becauſe I find that Alom is the chief and eſſential Ingredient of the <hi>Scarbrough Spaw</hi> Water, I ſhall (for further illuſtration) give my Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the <hi>Alom-Works</hi> at <hi>Whitby,</hi> to which place I purpoſely made a journey, for my own and others ſatisfaction; where firſt I obſerv'd, that it is not every Alom Mine that the Workmen will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their labour and time about, as finding ſome that are unripe, and therefore unfit to extract the Salt therefrom; amongſt which that blew Slate or Earth (which they often find near the true ripe Stone) which they call <hi>Doggers</hi> or <hi>Cats-heads;</hi> and other ſlaty Stone mixed therewith, they reject: which I cannot better parallel, then with thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe Mines which the Cole-miners often upon dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging find, and call <hi>Smitts,</hi> as being an imperfect Cole, whoſe Sulphur is not brought to maturity, wherefore they reject it as an unprofitable and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Fuel; and yet theſe may no leſs be reputed Coles, then the other unripe Alom Stone may be accounted Alom <hi>Minera:</hi> ſo that to expect that theſe crude Stones or Earth (which are akin to true Alom Stone) ſhould give a tincture with Galls in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58653:42"/>freſh Water (as ſome, not very cautiouſly, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted) is no leſs irrational, then to expect from theſe <hi>Smitts,</hi> all the eſſential qualifications belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true ripe Cole, though both are Cole.</p>
            <p>Next I obſerve, that when they have pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right <hi>Minera</hi> of Alom, they calcine it thus; firſt, digging great quantities thereof; then heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it <hi>Stratum ſuper Stratum, (viz.)</hi> a layer of Coals, and a layer of Stones; piling them up a great height in a vaſt bulk, like a little Mountain, they fire it below, and ſo let it burn day and night, till the fire of its own accord ceaſeth, or rather till all that is combuſtible be ſpent; when the Stone hath throughly taken fire, the whole Maſs burns much more intenſely then at the firſt, and that becauſe of a plenteous Sulphur connate with the Stone, which then becomes fired, and is thruſt forth to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Alom Stone, being a real combuſtible Sulphur, which as a Cruſt cleaves to the <hi>Minera,</hi> of which I have ſome by me, ſent by an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Friend.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We obſerve that this Calcination is therefore made of the <hi>Minera,</hi> that it may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more plentifully yeeld its innate Salt, partly by opening the body thereof by this previous Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and partly by preparing it for a Magnet for the nitrous Particles flowing from the Air to ſettle thereon; with which, by being the longer expoſed to the Air, it becomes the more ſaturated; plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, I ſaid, becauſe the natural Stone, unprepared or calcined, will ſometimes ſeparate its connate Salt to the ſuperficies thereof, by the bare ſolitary heat of the Sun: as I am by an Autopſie confirmed, in that I have ſometime ſeen an Alom Slate ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſweat forth its own Salt; which being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58653:42"/>in freſh Spring Water with the addition of Galls, I found would immediately ſtrike a deep pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and with Oil of Sulphur and Vitriol become clear; and then opace again with the addition of Tartar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Minera</hi> being thus opened by the Calcination, they make a Lee thereof, in Pirs made within the ground, which run one into another by Pipes or Channels; this Lee or Solution, they pump into Troughs which conveigh it into leaden Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, which will, with Galls, ſtrike a deep pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple colour, whereof they have whole Tuns, which will give that tincture, (as any who pleaſeth may try.) This Liquor conſiſts both of a Sulphur, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, Salt, and an Oaker, which as it runs along the Troughs, drills in ſome places through the crevices thereof, and by the heat of the Sun is congealed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salt, of which I procured a quantity to make Experiments with: This Salt will alſo (being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in freſh Spring Water, and filtred) give the purple colour with the addition of Galls.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. This Lee boyl'd up to ſuch a height in leaden Ciſterns, is pump'd into other Ciſterns, and there it precipitates a great quantity of a yellow ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous earthy Sediment, and ſo becomes purged of its droſs; then is it conveyed into other Ciſterns, where it meets with a decocted Lee of Kelp and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and thence (if I miſtake not) is pump'd up into the firſt Ciſtern and boyl'd again; then lets fall another Sediment, and then is ſent into low Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns within the ground, where it in part ſhoots; what doth not ſhoot, is pumped up into a boyling Ciſtern, and therein is brought to its due height; then is it pumped into great Tun Caskes, where it ſhoots into that form we find the factitious Alom
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58653:43"/>of. To the laſt decoction, in the boyling Ciſterns, is alwayes added its Mother, which is a Liquor which alwayes remains after ſhooting, and contributes much towards the chryſtallizing of freſh Alom Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>
            <p>But in their laſt decoction, which is performed in their roaching Pan, they boyl up that part which before was ſhot into grains in the lower Ciſterns, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that which did not ſhoot, (and all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the mixture with the additional Salts) into a due conſiſtence, and ſo they let it run into the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Tun-Casks to ſhoot.</p>
            <p>That this aluminous Salt is eſurine and ſharp, (as we have ſaid in our <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi>) as well as that of Vitriol, is evident by the Experiment of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a plate of Iron, ſuppoſe of about a quarter of a pound weight, into the laſt boyling Liquor, (which I caus'd to be tryed) which in a few hours was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally corroded and diſſolved, which in longer time would ſcarcely be toucht, when covered with a broad cloth, ſhred or liſt; and what is remarkable in this (but common to other mineral <hi>menſtruum</hi> fretting their proper bodies) was, that while the Iron was diſſolving, the Liquor did ferment, boyl and rage more than ordinarily; which when the Solution was over, ceaſed, although I muſt confeſs that it's probable, that the addition of the Salts of Kelp and Urine, may promote the corroſiveneſs of this Liquor, and may make it the more readily diſſolve Iron, and perhaps other Metals, if they were tryed in it.</p>
            <p>And were theſe Salts of Kelp totally alkalizate, (after the manner of the fixed Salts of common Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, made by the calcination of Plants, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked force of fire) would certainly prove deſtructive
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58653:43"/>to the Alom Work, and that becauſe the laſt are indued with a ſaltineſs, contrary and quite deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to all acid Salts, which after a ſharp conteſt would terminate not in Alom, but in a <hi>neutrum quid, (viz.) Tartarum Aluminoſum.</hi> But the Lee made out of the burnt Sea-wrack or Kelp, is over halanc'd with a Marine Salt, which (by a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preſſure or agitation of parts) works it ſelf into the texture of thoſe Sea-faring Plants, by unhinging ſome parts of their firſt compoſition, whence the brackiſhneſs and ſulphureous twang of the Lee of Kelp is produced.</p>
            <p>The addition of thoſe Salts, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of Kelp and Urine, perform two things, <hi>(viz.)</hi> firſt, cauſe a further ſeparation of a Sediment by the precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a kind of Oaker from the Alom Liquor; and next to that they add weight; and a third is not wanting, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to help the chryſtallizing or ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Alom: the firſt of which is evident, becauſe the artificial Alom will not with Galls ſtrike a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple colour, but the natural Alom with its imbred Oaker will: the laſt is as apparent, becauſe I have obſerved the natural to ſhoot in a different form from the Artificial, as I can ſhew. After the ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Alom, thoſe yellow and green ſordes, which are rejected, are uſed as a manure to ſome grounds; and that becauſe the Alom Earth, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Sediment of the Kelp, become as a Magnet, which attracts (if it be proper ſo to ſpeak) the fertilizing Nitre in the Air, the main efficient of improvements of all Soyls; the which, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, might be much promoted to a further improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grounds, if they were but calcin'd again, and then expos'd to the Air, by being thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ground; for hereby they would become more
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58653:44"/>hungry (if I may ſo ſay) of the volatile aëreal Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and make it fall the more plentifully by Rain and Dews, or Snow, and other manner of circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that vivifying Aether, which impregnates Grounds for all ſorts of vegetation; wherefore I have adviſed ſome that live upon <hi>Blacomore,</hi> (not far from <hi>Whitby,</hi> being a barren Soyl) to burn their Alom Slate Stone, (of which there is ſtore in that Countrey) after the manner as is done with Lime-ſtone in other parts of the Countrey; and when it is ſufficiently burnt, to throw it upon their Fallow Grounds; from whence probably an improvement worth their charge and labour may be made of that Soyl.</p>
            <p>Thus there are few ſorts of Soyls in <hi>England,</hi> or elſewhere, which are ſo barren as may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, by being artificially cultivated with what they bring forth, whether Alom-ſtone, Lime-ſtone, Marle, Cole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, there are few barren Soyles in the <hi>Indies</hi> or elſewhere, but have that in their Bowels, whoſe worth, one way or other, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate their thread bare Coats; the barrenneſs of their outſides, being well amended by the riches of their inwards. From what is premiſed, will neceſſarily reſult theſe following concluſions, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That to extract or ſeparate Salts or Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs out of Mineral Marcaſites, reſpect muſt be had to the crudity and maturity of the <hi>Mintra, (viz.)</hi> That ſuch a Bed is to be choſen, where the Mineral Principles are not too crude, but are brought on to a certain degree of maturity; as for inſtance, If a Coal-Mine be to be choſen, for burning well, it muſt be ſuch a one whoſe Sulphur is plentiful and flagrable, and not a <hi>Smitt,</hi> which is but an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cole-Mine: So if plenty of Alom-Salt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58653:44"/>to be ſeparated from the Marcaſite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; then muſt a ripe Stone be choſen, and not that blew Slate or Earth called <hi>Doggers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That to unlock ſome Mineral Beds to come at their hidden Treaſure, is required a foregoing Calcination by the force of fire; witneſs the burning of Alom-ſtone, before its Salt can be plentifully ſeparated, and the burning of Vitriol in cloſe or open Veſſels before its Spirit, or Salt can be procured.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the treaſures theſe unlock'd Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Bodies afford, conſiſt in a Salt, and an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryonative Sulphur; for inſtance, the Salt ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both from Alom and Vitriol, firſt opened by force of fire, and in both is an apparent Sulphur, <hi>viz.</hi> In Alom it appears in an inflamable ſulphurous Cruſt, thruſt forth to the ſurface of the Stone; and the ſame is apparent in Vitriol, both from what <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi> have wrote thereof; As alſo by the Experiment of pouring <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> upon Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, brought by gentle exiccation to a whiteneſs, by whoſe humid calcination of that Mineral, an impetuous cloud of ſulphurous Vapours ariſe, which if pent up in a cloſe Veſſel, would break it in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, though the ſtrongeſt imaginable, whoſe plenty of fumes are not inferior to thoſe which ariſe from the like <hi>menſtruum</hi> poured upon crude Antimony, or the Spirit of Nitre upon the Butter of Antimony, or the like <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> upon the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of <hi>Viride Aeris;</hi> which three metalline and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> Copper, Antimony, and Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol, I find by this Experiment to have the greateſt plenty of a combuſtible Sulphur; and it is by the influence of theſe two, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Salt and Sulphur,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58653:45"/>by which mineral and metalline bodies perform their moſt conſiderable cures upon the humane body.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That theſe acid Salts, thus opened, having their native Sulphurs diſſolv'd with them in a Lee of freſh Water, do by decoctions, and the addition of other Salts, as of Kelp and Urine, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Sulphurs, and other heterogeneous mixtures to ſeparate by precipitation; witneſs the plenteous ſeparation of the recremental faeces by the foreſaid operation from the Alom-Liquor.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That the Alom-Salt, whether natural or calcin'd, is eſurine and acid equally with the ſame in Vitriol, and capable of making ſolutions of other mineral bodies which lie in its way; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the natural ſucculent Alom Salt diſſolves a ſleight touch of the <hi>Minera</hi> of Iron in the <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough Spaw</hi> Water; and that either as it lies in the ſame Alom Bed, or at leaſt in a Vein of Iron, through which the acid aluminous Salt diſſolv'd in a Water Spring glides: The ſame doth the corroſion of the Iron in the Alom Liquor evince, according to our former Experiment.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That ſome <hi>menſtruums</hi> may diſſolve, or break in pieces the cloſe rivetted parts of ſome (but proper compact) bodies, when they yet leave other bodies of a ſofter and ſleighter texture untouched; witneſs the Alom Liquor corroding the Iron, when the Cloth Liſts, which had covered it, was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, though it had been longer in that Liquor than the naked Iron; which gives light to poſſibility of finding out by Art and Induſtry, ſuch <hi>menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> as may diſſolve and reduce <hi>in minima,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact Duelech, or hard ſtone of the Bladder, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58653:45"/>yet leave untouch'd the tender ſoft membrane which makes the concave of the Bladder, and other hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low bowels.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That to make acid <hi>menſtruums</hi> more powerful and more univerſal (eſpecially as to ſolid metalline or mineral bodies) is required an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other Salts, of ſuch a fabrick of parts, as may not by any inteſtine commotion deſtroy each other: but may acuate each other with a mutual invigora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ferment. Thus the Salts of Kelp and Urine do that to Alom Liquor, which the addition of <hi>Sal Gem,</hi> or <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> doth to an <hi>Aqua Fortis, (viz.)</hi> makes them diſſolve thoſe bodies, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not; the one forcibly to take in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the body of Iron, the other the body of Gold.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, That the Alkalizate Salts of moſt Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, made by naked force of fire, do differ from the <hi>Kali</hi> of Kelp, almoſt <hi>toto Coelo,</hi> although both be done by the like calcination; the one being <hi>acido ſaline, (viz.)</hi> that of the Kelp; the other, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the fixt Salts of Vegetables are lixiviate; by the difference of whoſe conſtituent parts, ariſeth the known ebullition made from the mixture of both.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That the <hi>faeces</hi> remaining after the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Alom Salt, and incremental addition of other Salts, do ſtill retain a kind of Magnetiſm of the Aethereal Nitre, or at leaſt become a proper ſubject for that fructifying Nitre to ſettle upon; whereby ſome Grounds may be improved, yea, and gives more then probable hopes that the ſame recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd, or the crude Stone once calcin'd, may well become a medium for the better improvement of ſome barren Soyls, as well as Lime-ſtone, Marl, <hi>faeces</hi> of Soap-aſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are by the like method made capable of enriching other Soyls.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:58653:46"/>
            <p> Now to confirm (beſides what is ſaid) the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency of Alom, as the chief (if not ſole) ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of ſome <hi>Spaws,</hi> I think it not amiſs to acquaint the Reader with my Obſervations on a <hi>Spaw</hi> of the ſame nature, which I found out the laſt Summer in <hi>Barnſdale</hi> upon <hi>Blacomore,</hi> about ten or twelve miles from <hi>Whitby;</hi> in the bottom of which Dale runs a Rivlet fed with ſeveral Springs, and walled in, (in ſome places) as it were, with Alom-Rocks on both ſides, but more on one ſide then on the other, out of the Clefts of one large Alom-Bed, (whoſe length may by conjectural compute be 50 or 60 paces, and the depth 4, 6, 8, or 10 yards.) I obſerv'd ſeveral Springs to iſſue forth, with a yellow Sediment, along the Chincks and Crevices; one of which that had the beſt current, broke forth two or three yards from the foot of the Alom-Rock, having more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it. This, when I taſted, I found very much in taſte to reſemble the <hi>Scarbrough Spaw,</hi> and would with the addition of Galls, readily ſtrike a purple tincture: being not a little glad hereat, I ordered a Bottle thereof to be brought along with me to <hi>York;</hi> which (there) bringing to the teſt, I found it to contain much-what the ſame Mineral Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents with that of the <hi>Scarbrough Spaw,</hi> but was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing near ſo plentifully fraught therewith as the other. But however by this it was clearly apparent, that a Water-Spring running through an Alom-Bed, might (and did) imbibe the immature Juyce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in ſo much as to give it a taſte reſembling that of the <hi>Scarbrough Spaw,</hi> and to render it as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of readily ſtriking a tincture with Galls, as the other, which was no ſmall confirmation of our Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, aſſerted in our <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi> concerning the <hi>Scarbrough Spaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:58653:46"/>
            <p> Had I been at my Antagoniſts back, when he was vindicating the exiſtency of Vitriol in our <hi>Spaw,</hi> I might have cheriſhed him, by whiſpering (yet I would firſt have been ſure to have had an anſwer <hi>in promptu</hi>) this Objection, to wit, <q>That Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the making of their Blacks, uſe not Alom but Vitriol, yea find Alom a great enemy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, alwayes mortifying the ſtiptick parts of thoſe Ingredients, which are neceſſarily required for that colour, and therefore might ſeem to argue againſt Alom, and for Vitriol as the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, made by Galls in the <hi>Spaw</hi> Water.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which Objection I thus return, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That this is done, firſt, becauſe Vitriol contains a greater quantity, by much of a precipitable Ocre, then Alom, which ſhould cloſe with the flats of aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent bodies, for the better intercepting of the Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Rayes, whereby that colour becomes made; next, becauſe factitious Alom having great plenty of Urine, the Spirits or Salts thereof doth precipitate the Ocre of Vitriol, and alſo deſtroys the acidity thereof, which ſhould otherwiſe bind in its Ocre, and confirm the ſtiptick or aſtringent parts of Galls, Sumach, Logwood, Elder Bark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> frequently uſed for Blacks.</p>

            <head>A <hi>Supplement to the</hi> Sweet-Spaw At KNARSBROUGH.</head>
            <p>WHat I have ſaid in my <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Sweet-Spaw</hi> at <hi>Knarsbrough,</hi> I find no reaſon to reclaim, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the carping of ſome, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of others; for that it hath imbibed but a ſmall quantity from a <hi>Minera</hi> or Marcaſite of Iron, is apparent; firſt, becauſe upon its evaporation it leaves an inſipid dark coloured Pouder, arguing that the Vitrioline Marcaſite, over which this Spring Water glides, is very thin and lean, of a Vitrioline Acidity, and that is the reaſon it coagulates not Milk, as do the <hi>German</hi> Vitrioline <hi>Spaws,</hi> and ſome of our own: which happens not as Dr. <hi>French</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth, from a volatility of its acidity, which eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porates before the Milk boyls, but rather from the inconſiderableneſs of the acidity, and the eaſie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation of its Ocre.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By the great quantity of that Water which is to be drunk, before any ſenſible Operation can be made, either by Stool or Urine; inſomuch as it gives juſt cauſe of ſuſpition that it is moſt-what from the weight of that Water preſſing upon thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctories, which chiefly gives energy to its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:58653:47"/>
            <p> Thirdly, The ſame is evident from the Mineral Waters, which are Springs, paſſing through ſome Vitrioline Marcaſites, which are found in Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, of which I have ſome by me; with theſe are thoſe Springs, drilling through Cole-Mines, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten impregnated, many of which have a Vitrioline taſte, and will ſtrike a purple tincture with Galls, of which ſort is Old Town <hi>Spaw,</hi> and ſome near <hi>Leids</hi> and <hi>Hawton,</hi> &amp;c. ſome of which have a ſleight Iron-like, or vitrioline taſte, and yet are ſo thin and poor, as not to be able to give any tincture with Galls, while others of them that are ſtrong, give both tincture and taſte.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The ſame is apparent by obſerving, that all theſe languid vitrioline Waters, if they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſtagnate, being expoſed to the Air, or by motion be carried to a great diſtance, and if by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, a little yellow Sediment be precipitated, then forthwith they become effete in their vertues, and have neither any diſtinguiſhable taſte, nor will give any colour with Galls, but degenerate again into ſimple Spring Water. So that the ſuppoſed Spirits of theſe Waters are only imaginary and mere Chimera's, no where exiſtent, but in the brains of thoſe who conceive them.</p>
            <p>For further confirmation of what I have already ſaid, and ſhall now further add concerning this and other the like mineral vitrioline <hi>Spaws,</hi> I will elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidate it by this following Experiment, <hi>(viz.)</hi> I took a bright Cuprous, or Vitrioline Marcaſite, found about the ſurface of Cole-Mines, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards expoſed to the Air, upon which (without any other preparation) I poured ſimple diſtilled Water in a Jar Glaſs, which, <hi>in frigido,</hi> did immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately receive a vitrioline taſte; and being forthwith
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58653:48"/>filtred from the Marcaſite, ſtruck a deep purple tincture with Galls, as deep as any vitrioline <hi>Spaw</hi> I have yet met with; its taſte was exactly like that of the <hi>Sweet-Spaw,</hi> we are now treating of, and would, as other the like Vitrioline <hi>Spaws,</hi> be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to its priſtine clarity, by the pouring a few drops of Oyl of Vitriol; and became opace, by the adding of Oyl of Tartar, and ſo paſſed thoſe colours found in the Vitrioline <hi>Spaws,</hi> as we have hinted more at large in our <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe Mineral Waters; from which Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may follow theſe direct and collateral conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That Vitrioline Marcaſites are allyed unto, and generally found in thoſe Mines where Sulphur is much predominant, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Cole-Mines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea themſelves are impregnated with an immature Sulphur, witneſs their combuſtibleneſs, if put upon hot Coles, burning with a blew flame, and yeelding a ſulphureous fume.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That theſe being expoſed to the Air, become the more readily ingravidated with a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioline Salt, by determining the nitrous Particles, floating in the Air upon its Body, by a peculiar Magnetiſm (if I may ſo ſay) proper to ſuch bodies; and this is evident, becauſe the longer theſe Marca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites are expoſed to the open Air, the more they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fraught with a vitrioline body, contracting a Cruſt, which by ſolution, filtration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolve into a body of Vitriol.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That theſe, and their connatural and analogous Juyces do increaſe, and <hi>(ſuo more)</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getate in the Earth as other Minerals do, is apparent in that I have obſerved a piece of Wood invelloped with a vitrioline Cruſt found in the Earth, where
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58653:48"/>other Marcaſites of the like nature have been dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which I keep by me.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That theſe Marcaſites, the nearer they lie to the ſurface of the Earth, and the more patent the Channels are, by which currents of Spring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glide by them; the more readily they give their tincture, or yeeld a ſolution of their ſubſtance, whence ſome vitrioline Springs or <hi>Spaws</hi> become ſtronger, both in taſte and operation, then others; and this is evident, becauſe of the facile ingreſs the Air hath to theſe places.</p>
            <p>Nor may this contradict what we elſewhere ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> That an Eſurine Acidity, preying upon the <hi>Minera</hi> of Iron, gets a ſleight touch therefrom, and ſo becomes as Vitriol of the <hi>Minera</hi> of Iron, which gives eſſence to the Vitrioline or <hi>Sweet-Spaw</hi> at <hi>Knarsbrough;</hi> for both may be true, though in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reſpects, from different Soyls; in as much as there are even in theſe Marcaſites a connatural acid Juyce, reaſolvable by the confluence of Air, which ſeizeth on an embryonative Sulphur of Iron, eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to thoſe Concretes, which are carried together in their mutual imbraces, by a preterlabent Spring of Water, unto the place where they break forth, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Spring-head, which gives Original to all or moſt of the <hi>Spaws</hi> called <hi>Fontes acidi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that all Vitrioline <hi>Spaws</hi> are reducible to one of theſe two Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Either to a ſulphureous acid Spirit, diſſolv'd in a Water-Spring, paſſing through the <hi>Minera</hi> of Iron, the acidity diſſolving the looſer parts thereof, and coagulating it ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or to the foreſaid Vitrioline Marcaſites, whoſe acidity being reſolv'd by the Air in the bowels of Earth, takes along with it the connate immature Sulphur, or looſe vitrioline Ocre; and both in one
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58653:49"/>gives eſſence to theſe Mineral Waters, and from the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> two cauſes ſingly and joyntly, do the <hi>Spaws</hi> of <hi>Knarsbrough, Rotheram, Oulton, Turnbridg, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrap, &amp;c.</hi> take their Original; amongſt which thoſe that have but ſleighter touches of the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and conſequently do the more readily ſuffer a precipitation of their Earth or Ocre, fetch their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in a longer line from the place of their Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that too perhaps from Marcaſites more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious, and leſs opened then others which keep their Minerals unprecipitated, and conſequently their Vertues the longer.</p>
            <p>Theſe Marcaſites, calcin'd in a Crucible with a blaſt, will melt and flow, eſpecially helped with Nitre; which melted Maſs being poured forth, gives no <hi>Regulus</hi> or metalline body, nor is ſo pondrous as it was before, but hath ſome bright yellow, or cuprous ſparkles interſpers'd. This in two dayes time, doth almoſt all fall to a black Pouder, much like what I remember hapned to a <hi>Scoria</hi> of Iron in the making <hi>Regulus Martis;</hi> which being laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the Air, did in a few dayes fall into a black Pouder.</p>
            <p>Wherefore theſe Stones are without doubt a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Embryo, conſiſting of a Salt and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sulphur, which hath ſcarce begun the matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial embraces of its <hi>Mercury,</hi> and therefore at the beſt is but a Mineral in the road to metallizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and being plentifully impregnated with an acid ſulphureous Salt, whoſe other Ingredients hanging but looſly on, makes it the more readily ſoluble in a preterlabent Spring of Water; for I have, for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment ſake, onely ſuffered ſimple diſtilled Water to ſlide over one of them, and have found thereby that the Water would by ſo ſleight a gliding over,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58653:49"/>ſtrike a purple tincture with Galls, which it will do again and again to freſh Water, yeelding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an inexhauſtible treaſure to the tranſient Springs of Water.</p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe Marcaſites, I have one by me bright and ſparkling, cut into curious angular forms, like ſo many Diamonds of ſeveral ſizes ſet in a Ground, as if Nature in this neat peice of work, did vie with Art. And yet in the very Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of theſe Diamond-like cuts, (betwixt each other) is conſpicuous the Mineral Salt which gives Eſſence and Operation to moſt of the Vitrioline <hi>Spaws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Mineral Waters may (I confeſs) be ſuch as are only acid, being only impregnated with the Eſurine Salt of the Earth, and have no addition in them of Mineral Sulphurs, neither of Iron nor Copper; of which ſort I have taſted one near <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterfield</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> which hath a very ſtrong ſowriſhneſs, but yet, with Galls, gives no tincture, although I found a reddiſh Ocre to lie along the ſides of the Current.</p>
            <p>The like (I doubt not) may be found in other places; all which may notwithſtanding prove very good Waters to open Obſtructions in the body of man, by their penetrative Vertues.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, A ſolution of Salt of Iron in Water, with Galls, gives a deep purple tincture, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all other mutations of colours anſwerable to all natural Mineral Waters. But the ſolution of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Vitriol, (with Galls added) gives no purple colour, but becomes a muddied Liquor, which, with Oyl of Tartar aſſuſed, becomes greeniſh, but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58653:50"/>with Oyl of Sulphur wholly green. The ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations doth <hi>Viride Aeris</hi> ſuffer with the ſame additions.

            <head>A <hi>further Account of the</hi> Sulphur-Well <hi>At</hi> KNARSBROUGH.</head>
            <head type="sub">As alſo concerning The Original of Hot Baths and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Waters.</head>
            <p>WHat I have ſaid in my <hi>Hydrolog. Chym.</hi> concerning the eſſential cauſe of this Mineral-Water, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That it conſiſts (as a <hi>Spaw</hi>) of a <hi>Sal-marine</hi> or foſſile Salt (which differ not either materially or formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) impregnated with an embryonative faetid Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, or rather ſulphureous odour, is (I ſay) true, and may be illuſtrated after a double manner; And that firſt, by the collateral Experiments I have there inſerted, concerning an embryonative Sulphur, as faetid as this <hi>Spaw</hi> Water it ſelf, cloſe locked up in the body of <hi>Sal-marine;</hi> as at large is made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by that Experiment, which I ſhall not now inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, (and now more to the purpoſe) the ſame will better be diſcovered by a freſh light; let in by ſome new Experiments: only before I proceed to produce what I have to urge herein, I ſhall firſt (taking things as they lie in my way) make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiery
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58653:51"/>what Ingredients are not (though by ſome ſuppoſed to be) in this Spring, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That neither Vitriol, Nitre, nor Sulphur, (as to the body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) are the conſtitutive Principles hereof.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Vitriol is not here, is apparent; firſt, becauſe it will ſtrike no tincture with Galls, which any Mineral Water, that hath but the leaſt partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Vitriol will readily do; but this Spring, with the addition of Galls, gives no purple at all; next, becauſe upon evaporation or diſtillation of this Water, no Vitrioline Ocre is found, with which ſuch Waters (whilſt in the vigour of their Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) are conſtantly impregnated, and as certainly let fall to the bottom, when effaete in their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>Nay further, the ſame is apparent by this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Experiment, <hi>(viz.)</hi> I took ſome of the Vitriol Marcaſites (of which more anon) found in the Bog, about 240 paces North-weſt from the Well, upon which, groſly bruiſed, I poured a ſtrong ſolution of <hi>Sal marinum Hiſpanicum,</hi> made in diſtilled Water, and ſet them <hi>in frigido</hi> in a long glaſs body; from the commixture of which, I found no ſulphureous <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porrhea</hi> to ariſe, but the ſolution became green; which being decanted, and evapored, or diſtilled, (which laſt, as I remember, I did to try if it would yeeld any <hi>effluvia</hi> of Sulphur, but found none) I obtained a yellow Salt in Chryſtals, with a Vatrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Ocre or Sulphur at the bottom; which Salt was the <hi>Sal-marine,</hi> ting'd with the vitrioline body, (of which I have ſome by me): for being diſſolv'd again in freſh diſtilled Water, it will, with the addition of Galls, ſtrike a deep tincture; yea, the <hi>liquamen</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the Mother, as the Vitriol or Alom-workmen
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58653:51"/>call it) which ſhoots not, will (if diluted with Water) give the ſame colour.</p>
            <p>By which it is plain, that as Vitriol gives no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour or <hi>effluvia</hi> of its Sulphur, to a ſolution of Salt; ſo neither conſequently doth it yeeld the ſame to this Salt Water, conſidered ſimply as ſuch: we will ſuppoſe that the Salt Spring in the Earth (I mean the Spring impregnated with Salt) may in its paſſage run through theſe Marcaſites of Vitriol, which are found not far from thence, (as I ſhall afterwards prove it doth) it would of neceſſity (if ſimple Salt) make ſome ſleight ſolution thereof, and give its Indications anſwerable to our Experiment, by receiving a tincture from Galls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, I find it not ſo to do; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Vitriol, as ſuch, is no Ingredient of this <hi>Sulphur-Well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That there is no Nitre, is as evident, in as much as, in the Analyſis of this Water, no ſuch Ingredient is to be found; for neither doth there appear any Salt which ſhoots into ſuch Styria's, nor that hath any inflammable property; both which are eſſential to Nitre, as ſuch.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Nor is Sulphur (as to the body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) an Ingredient of this Spring, notwithſtanding that it hath its denomination therefrom, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Sulphur-Well;</hi> and this is evidently appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, becauſe in the genuine reſolution of this <hi>Spaw</hi> Water into its Principles, not one grain of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible Sulphur is to be found; for upon a gentle diſtillation thereof, in Glaſs Veſſels cloſely ſtopt, the ſulphureous odour goes off in much leſs then the third part of the Water, which is firſt diſtilled. The reſt which diſtils, is ſimple Water without any odour or taſte; and what remains in the bottom, (which I filtred, though it ſtood not in much need
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58653:52"/>thereof) was a <hi>liquamen</hi> of Salt, which being eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated a little more, ſhot into a Salt of cubical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; exactly in taſte, colour, figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, yea, the very ſame with a Foſſil, or Marine Salt, having an inconſiderable addition of Alom Salt leſt after precipitation of the Sulphur; ſo that nothing of Sulphur, or any the leaſt inflammable matter can be ſeparated from the <hi>Spaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt what I ſay hereof, I have met with an Objection, urg'd by a Phyſitian of note, who grounds it upon this Experiment, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Sulphur Water, or others of the like nature, which break forth higher upon the Bank, above the uſual Spring: I ſay, that upon theſe Waters reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating, is found a kind of white Cremor, (which ſometimes is of various colours) this being skim'd off, and dryed, will take flame and burn; which by matter of fact I have my ſelf upon tryal found true.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That this Sulphur which thus ſeparates from this reſtagnating Water, is the ſame with that which ſwims upon other ſorts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters upon long ſtanding, being a blewiſh cream or skin, which ſwims as well upon the <hi>Sweet-Spaw,</hi> and any Vitrioline, or other Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and (as Dr. <hi>Heer</hi>'s ſaith) being put upon the fire, is inflamed, and yeelds a ſulphureous odor: The ſame is alſo found in an Azure coloured skin, ſwimming upon the reſtagating <hi>Scarbrough Spaw</hi> Water: Yea, the like is frequently to be ſeen upon Water that ſtands long upon any Bog.</p>
            <p>This Sulphureous skin which ſwims upon moſt Mineral Waters, is referrable to a double Original, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Either they are ſuch as have a bituminous matter ſwimming upon them; which with the Water
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58653:52"/>Spring, iſſues forth joyntly out of the bowels of the Earth, from ſome ſulphureous or bituminous ſource; witneſs the Spring at <hi>Pitchford</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> and in <hi>Averna</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> The <hi>Mare Aſphaliticum,</hi> called <hi>Mare Mortuum,</hi> which hath plenty of Naptha and Bitumen iſſuing from the Shores, which have ſtore of bituminous Pits.</p>
            <p>As alſo that Water, <hi>in agro Parmenſi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Falop.</hi> 24.6.</note> according to <hi>Falopius,</hi> of which Water he ſaith, <hi>Eſt uſque aduò bituminoſis vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus referta; ut ex flammâ vix ſibi ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeâ accendatur:</hi> And that likewiſe, <hi>in agro Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino;</hi> and all other Waters, upon which ſwim Camphire, Amber, <hi>in ſucco ſuo ſoluto,</hi> (both which by <hi>Falopius Cardanus, Agricola</hi> and <hi>Caſius,</hi> are accounted, <hi>è genere bituminis) Piſaſphaltum, Petroleum, Balſamus Indicus, &amp;c.</hi> all which are reckoned as various <hi>ſpecies de genere bituminis;</hi> in all which the bituminous skin will take fire and burn with a ſulphureous flame; for as no Oil, ſo neither Sulphur, nor the <hi>Bitumina,</hi> will mingle, <hi>per mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> with Water, Oyls, and Sulphurs, conſiſting of ſimilar parts, which bear no proportion with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Particles, unleſs the watery be ſubjugated by an oyly Ferment. Or,</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are ſuch as (whilſt in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the Earth) are impregnated with Minerals, (although perhaps not ſulphureous) but when they come into the open Air, preſently (eſpecially by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnation) let fall their imbibed Ingredients, and by continuance of time ſuffer a ſulphureous matter to be generated <hi>de novo;</hi> or rather indeed, as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, by long ſtanding, ſuffer the Air, by a kind of putrefactive ferment, to cauſe a ſlow reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the very compage of Water; and in this
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58653:53"/>gentle Analyſis, makes the reſtagnating Water caſt its Sulphur, which was not preexiſtent in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as a Mineral Sulphur; but is (as I ſaid) either a bituminous Cremor, or a Sulphur of Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred by a putrefactive reſolution thereof; which will, being dryed, take flame and burn.</p>
            <p>That I might make a ſeſemblance of this Water, the better to inquire into the nature thereof, I took one ounce of <hi>Hepar Antimonii,</hi> upon which, pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized, I poured ſome warm Water; into which, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, we dropt ſome little ſolution of Alom Salt, (for I knew Vinegar would do it, as is uſual in the making of Sulphur <hi>Auratum Antimonii</hi>) and it forthwith ſeparated the Sulphur of Antimony with a ſtrong ſulphureous odor, not unlike that of the <hi>Sulphur-Well;</hi> and being filtred, was the ſame in taſte and ſmell: by which I learned what that was which precipitated the body of Sulphur after its firſt ſolution in the Water from its native <hi>Minera, viz.</hi> That it was an Alom Juyce, in which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, in as much as I find a Bed of Alom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of ten yards from the breaking forth of that <hi>Well;</hi> from the ſurface of whoſe Stones, I have taken a Salt, which (diſſolv'd in freſh Water) I found would ſtrike a deep tincture with Galls; yea, the very Stone it ſelf, being put into freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will, with Galls, give the very ſame colour; of which very thing I have not met with any that have taken notice, either thoſe who have wrote of, or others who have frequented the <hi>Spaws;</hi> and though I found hereby, what was the ſecond Juyce which precipitated the body of Sulphur, and had made its <hi>Apporrhea</hi> or volatile odor to appear, yet was I ſtill at a loſs what this Sulphur was, or from what body, and by what ſolvent it firſt became
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58653:53"/>looſened or prepared; for all Sulphurs, whether in their own Earth, or wrapt up in mineral or metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Veins, till they be opened by ſome particular and proper Solvents, are not fit to give forth their volatile parts, nor to ſtrike the noſtrils with their odor.</p>
            <p>And that Water impregnated with <hi>Sal marine,</hi> is not ſufficient to open the body of a mineral Sulphur, and conſequently not adapted for a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> is apparent by this following Experiment, <hi>(viz.)</hi> I took a pint of Spring Water, and diſſolv'd two or three dragms of <hi>Sal marine</hi> therein, (which is the quantity, at the moſt, which the <hi>Sulphur-Well</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the body of Salt) into which I poured three ounces of the Marcaſites of Vitriol aforeſaid; then ſtirred the mixture very well; after that I pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red off ſome of the Liquor, and filtred it, which would neither tinge Silver, nor yeeld a ſulphureous odor; but to try whether <hi>Sal marine</hi> would at all open the body of Sulphur in the Marcaſites, as ſome ſuppos'd, I added to the filtred Liquor, a ſolution of Alom Salt, as I had done for the precipitation of the Sulphur of Antimony, out of the ſolution of Hepar, but found no precipitation, coagulation, nor alteration of that Sulphur, either in colour or ſmell, nor would it at all tinge Silver; all which it would have done to an opened and prepared Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sulphur.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of the <hi>Sal marine,</hi> had indeed made ſuch a ſolution of the Vitrioline parts of the Marcaſites, as rendred it capable of receiving a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from Galls, but had not at all touched the ſulphureous parts thereof.</p>
            <p>But before I depoſite my own Theſis of the true native Ingredients of this <hi>Spaw,</hi> which ſhall be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58653:54"/>clearly demonſtrated by Experiment. I would firſt take off what Dr. <hi>French</hi> opinionates thereon, who ſaith thus, As for the ſtinking odour thereof, (ſpeaking of the <hi>Sulphur-Well</hi>) that I ſuppoſe is cauſed from the vapours of the burning Bitumen, and aduſt terreneſs therewith; and therefore he judgeth it to be hot in its original ſource, in the manner of <hi>Hot Baths,</hi> who ſuppoſeth ſubterreſtrial fires, ſed with a bituminous or ſulphureous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not only to cauſe hot Springs or Baths, but alſo to give being to the faetidneſs of ſuch ſulphure. ous Waters.</p>
            <p>Now this is (I confeſs) an Opinion that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he, but <hi>Falopius, Empedocles, Agricola, Caſius, Kircher</hi> and others hold; for by two wayes they did ſuppoſe all Waters to be heated, <hi>Nam aquarum</hi> (according to <hi>Empedocles) aliae calefiunt quia tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeant per ſaxoſa loca, quibus ſubjectus fit ignis ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens in metallo ſulphureo vel bituminoſo; aliae inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſeunt quia tranſeant per ipſum metallum ignitum &amp; ardens,</hi> as thought <hi>Agricola.</hi> Nor was <hi>Falopius</hi> much otherwiſe minded, who treating <hi>de aquis Patavinis,</hi> whoſe ſulphureous odour is not much unlike that of our <hi>Sulphur-Well,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ques halitus ſulphuris Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavinis, iſte aqua habent non ideo quia bullient in metallo ipſo ſulphureo; ſed quoniam tranſeant ſupra loca, ſub quibus ebullit ſulphuri, ex quo efferuntur vapores ad cuniculos, &amp; cum aquâ miſcentur;</hi> from whence he grounds his Opinion, that the difference of Hot Baths, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That ſome are intenſly hot, others moderately; ſome tepid and ſubtepid, others cold; proceed from theſe two, <hi>(viz.) Paucitas &amp; diſtantia ignis,</hi> The ſcarcity and diſtance of the fire.</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:58653:54"/>
            <p> In anſwer to which Opinions, I thus return, <hi>viz,</hi> That although I cannot deny but that there are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Fires, which being once inkindled, feed upon ſulphureous Minerals, witneſs the Eruptions of <hi>Aetna, Veſuvius, Strongilo,</hi> and other Vulca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Mountains; yet do not I ſee cauſes ſufficient to convince me, that theſe give being to all our Hot Baths, or that their Vapours gives faetidneſs to ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous Waters. That there may be ſome hot Baths adjacent to thoſe ſulphurous burnings, which probably may be heated by paſſing over thoſe places <hi>in cuniculis,</hi> under which a bituminous matter burns, I ſhall not deny; witneſs that in <hi>Apulia,</hi> called <hi>Tribulus,</hi> where is plenty of Aſhes and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd Stones; and thoſe about the Lake <hi>Lucrinus</hi> and <hi>Avernus;</hi> and that in <hi>Agro Valaterano,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Falopius;</hi> Yet we ſcarce read of any in in <hi>Campania,</hi> where is the Hill <hi>Veſuvius;</hi> nor in <hi>Sicily,</hi> where <hi>Mont Gibello</hi> belcheth forth flames; nor in other places where theſe Eruptions are, do Hot Baths more frequently appear, then in thoſe places where there is found not the leaſt ſuſpition of any Forge of <hi>Vulcan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That theſe Subterranean Fires are not the cauſes of our hot Mineral Waters, or ſulphureous Springs in general, will be evident; if we conſider, firſt, that it's more then probable, that a ſubterraneal fire is no more naturally implanted in the bowels of the Earth, then the imaginary elementary fire is to be found <hi>ſub concavo Lunae;</hi> which, though it may ſeem as a Paradox to ſome, yet duly conſidered, it will not appear irrational; for the <hi>materia ſubſtrata</hi> of all inflammable concretions, whether in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the Earth, or upon the ſuperſicies thereof, or in the common <hi>expauſum</hi> of the Air, muſt be a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58653:55"/>combuſtible matter common to them all, and that muſt be bituminous, unctuous, or ſulphureous; al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> which, whether in Subterraneal Caverns, or upon the Surface of the Earth, or in the Aereal Region, may (I ſay) take flame, and burn from ſome one of theſe three Cauſes, <hi>(viz.)</hi> either from Motion, Corruſcation, or Lightning; or <hi>flamma de flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ,</hi> one fire inkindling another; to which we may add a fourth, (which yet may be included in one of the three) <hi>(viz.)</hi> from ſome Mineral Marcaſites acuated by air and moiſture, inſtance Alom and Coperous Mines, being in parcels broken, expoſed and moiſtned, will gather an actual heat, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much more of thoſe Minerals, then elſe the Mine would yeeld; as the learned Dr. <hi>Jorden,</hi> in his Diſcourſe of <hi>Natural Baths;</hi> and the ingenious Dr. <hi>Power,</hi> in his <hi>Microſ. obſ. Confirmes;</hi> yea, and that Braſs lumps (which are a ſort of Marca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite) being laid in heaps, and expoſed to the moiſt Air, or ſprinkled with Water, will ſmoke and grow exceeding hot, and ſometimes take fire, and burn all that is about it, as the foreſaid Dr. <hi>Power</hi> proves: So the Mines of Tin-Glaſs, expoſed after the ſame manner, to the moiſt Air, will become very hot; and Quick-Lime will do the ſame.</p>
            <p>The like Dr. <hi>Jorden</hi> obſerves in thoſe Stone Coals called <hi>Metal Coals,</hi> which are mixed with a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſite, containing ſome Mineral Juyce, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving moiſture, doth dilate it ſelf, and grow ſo hot, as oftentimes great heaps of thoſe Coals are kindled thereby, and burnt before their time, as hath been ſeen at <hi>Puddle-Wharf</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and at <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> although theſe laſt I account do not much differ from the aforeſaid Coperas Marca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:58653:55"/>
            <p> Now ſeeing that all combuſtible Concretes may contract a heat, yea, may actually take flame, and burn from ſome of the foreſaid cauſes; witneſs the heating and firing of a Coach-Wheel, by too rapid a motion; the burning of Houſes, Trees, Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by Lightning and Thunder; the taking flame of one combuſtible matter by another; and laſtly, the ſelf-inkindling of a Ryck of Hay or Corn, which hath been laid up too moiſt; and the taking fire of ſeveral Marcaſites, by being expoſed to the moiſt Air, as aforeſaid: Therefore I ſee no reaſon why a Meteor or Comet, which ſuppoſe brought to that body of ſulphurous Exhalations, and taking flame from its own motion, or from Lightning, or from what other cauſe, ſhould leſs be reputed an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Fire, <hi>ſub Concavo Lunae;</hi> then thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal fires kindled (according to all probability) occaſionally (not to ſay accidentally, <hi>quoad nos</hi>) from ſome of the foreſaid cauſes, ſhould be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted native to the Earth, or naturally implanted therein, for the production of all Mineral and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline bodies: ſo that as the one is irrational, and is exploded by our modern Philoſophers; ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the other may ſeem as irrational, if we do but further conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, How impoſſible it is for actual fire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the cauſe of generation of Minerals or Metals, as ſome ſuppoſe, who imagine the Fire as a Native born in the Earth; ſeeing fire, I mean, flaming or glowing fire, is by the graveſt of Philoſophers ſo far rejected from amongſt the cauſes of Generation, as it is rather juſtly to be reputed <hi>mors rerum artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioſa,</hi> the death or deſtroyer of all things, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting actual rapine upon all the Seminary Principles of bodies, which fall under its tyranny, diſperſing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58653:56"/>and diſſipating thoſe Concretions ſuddenly, which Nature (helped by a generative heat working upon imbred Seminals) had taken a long time to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile together, making havock of the neat Structures of Bodies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, How unlikely it is for Water to be ſo diſpoſed in the Earth; in what Veſſels can it be imagined to lodg? Yea, how theſe fancied <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylacia</hi> can be ſo well placed, as they may beſt be capable to receive the fires, from the as much fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pyrophylacia,</hi> without danger of the Waters fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the fires and quenching them, ſo as to make the heated <hi>Hydrophylacia</hi> the cauſe of Hot Baths; for cannot Water as eaſily deſcend or ſlip down thoſe ſmall Chinks and Cranies, and ſmother that Demigorgon, as the fire could aſcend to heat theſe Ciſterns of Water? unleſs we imagine the Water included in ſome vaſt Kettles, (and ſo was heated by the playing of the flames about) and then we muſt be forced to think of a <hi>Vulcan</hi> to be before his Fires; who muſt firſt hammer out theſe large Caldrons, preparing empty Veſſels for us to fill with our watery conceits.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If we ſhould grant the poſſibility of theſe actual Subterraneal Fires, as connatural to the Earth, why ſhould we not find Minerals and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals melted inſtead of being generated? and why we ſhould not, where theſe fires meet with Vitriol and Nitre, or Vitriol and Salt, find ſtore of <hi>Aqua Fortis?</hi> and meeting with Sulphur, ſhould not give us plenty of Oil of Sulphur, <hi>tanquam per campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> being the winding Crevices of the Earth would do the like as Glaſs Bells for conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>And to confirm further what we ſay concerning the occaſional or accidental inkindling of combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter, in the intrals of the Earth, I ſhall call in a Teſtimonial Inſtance, out of Mr. <hi>Burton</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> who ſaith, <q>That at <hi>Coal-Eaton</hi> in that County, in the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the Coal-Mines there did burn for many years together, and could not be quenched, until the ſulphurous and brimſtony matter (whereupon it wrought) was utterly exhauſted and conſumed.</q> The like fire in Coal-Mines, was in the year 1622. burning near <hi>Willingſworth</hi> and <hi>Weddesbury,</hi> in the County of <hi>Stafford;</hi> not unlike which was a ſudden erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fire in the Coal-Mines at <hi>Sunderland,</hi> in the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> (as I was informed by my learned Friend Mr. <hi>J. H.</hi> who had it confirmed by a Gentleman of that County, who had been Page to King <hi>James</hi>) where by a ſudden eruption of fire, to the number of about five perſons working in the bottom of the Pit, were conſumed and deſtroyed; ſeveral of their Members, as Arms, Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were found torn from their bodies.</p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:58653:57"/>
            <p> The laſt inſtance might be a ſulphureous Damp; or arſenical malignant Steam, ariſing from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of heterogeneal mineral Juyces or Spirits, which by the flame of a Candle (which the Miners frequently have to work by day and night) might very probably take fire, and ſo by its unimagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force, might eaſily act that Tragical Scene.</p>
            <p>The other Inſtances evidence the poſſibility of Subterraneal Fires from occaſional and accidental Cauſes, which may, not unlikely, be transferred (I mean from the like cauſes) to thoſe Ignivomous Mountains, <hi>Aetna, Veſuvius, Strongilo,</hi> &amp;c. So that as a Subterraneal Fire was inkindled in Coal-Mines, which continued for many years; during which time it was as real ſubterraneal Fire (and as probable from the ſame cauſes) as thoſe fired Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Only the main Objection I meet with, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuation of thoſe bituminous and ſulphurous Fires of the flaming Furnaces of <hi>Aetna, Veſuvius,</hi> &amp;c. which thoſe other fires in coal-mines do not; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as ſome ſuppoſe, are ſed by a large-Central or Abyſſal Fire; witneſs <hi>Kircher, Abyſſorum omnium pyrophylacticarum maximam ſancti patres in centro terrae non incongrue ſtatuerint, eternum improbis ad penam deſtinatum carcerem:</hi> which (as he ſuppoſeth) is no leſs then Hell Fire, and the Confines thereof to be his other <hi>Pyrophylacia,</hi> which heat the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drophylacia,</hi> and gives Original to all Hot Baths: which being a figment from the Center to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, from the beginning to the end, I ſhall not take ſo much liberty now as to inſiſt upon it.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon, I would ſay, why the Vulcano's are kept burning with a perpetual Fire, is the vaſt quantities of bituminous and ſulphureous matter
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58653:58"/>lodg'd in thoſe great Hills; which having once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fire, burn on, and then comes about in a great round; and as it hath conſumed the combuſtible matter on one ſide, it goes further on to conſume the other; which whilſt it's doing, that vacant part retaining yet (eſpecially in the Earth therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts) the Seeds of thoſe ſulphurous mineral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, produceth the like <hi>de novo,</hi> wch becomes freſh Fuel when the Fire wheels about again, ſtill the Mineral Seeds being at work, produceth freſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals in the deſerted ſpaces, where the Earth yet retains the ſeminal Juyces of thoſe combuſtible Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and thus may the Circle of thoſe Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Fires be perpetuated, and not fed from any Central or Hell Fire implanted in the Earth; which may well be confirmed, in as much as it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that Minerals and Metals are generated anew in the ſame places out of which they have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly digged; witneſs the profit (<hi>Falopius</hi> ſaith) the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> hath by it; and what <hi>Sandiv.</hi> ſaith, That there have been Metals found in Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, where formerly there have been none left.</p>
            <p>Thus not onely Nitre is afreſh to be got out of the ſame Earth it was formerly extracted from; but the like is obſerved in the Minerals of Vitriol and Alom; yea, the Generation of Metals, are not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with one production, it ceaſeth not there, but the Mineral Seed gathereth ſtrength by inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it ſelf, continually proceeds to ſubjugate more matter under its Government; ſo as where once a Generation is begun, it continues many Ages, and ſeldom gives over: Thus Dr. <hi>Jordan</hi> hath obſerved from the Tinners in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> That they have, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thirty years, found Tin generated <hi>de novo,</hi> where it hath been formerly all digged up and filled with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58653:58"/>Earth. The like hath been obſerved of Iron, in the Mines of <hi>Ilva,</hi> an Iſland in the <hi>Adriatick Sea,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Venetians,</hi> where the Iron breeds continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as faſt as they can work it, which is confirmed by <hi>Agricola</hi> and <hi>Baccius.</hi> The like at <hi>Saga</hi> in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giis,</hi> where they (as the ſame Dr. <hi>Jordan</hi> obſerveth) dig again their Iron-Mines every tenth year. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſius</hi> gives examples of almoſt all ſorts of Minerals and Metals, which he hath obſerved to grow and regenerate. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> (as Dr. <hi>J.</hi> notes) affirms that he ſaw in <hi>S. Joachims</hi> Dale, Silver grown upon a Beam of Wood, which was placed in the Pit to ſupport the works. The like of reproductions of Metals, is alſo obſerved in the Lead-Mines at <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dip</hi> and the <hi>Peak,</hi> which do not only ſtretch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in extent of ground, then hath been obſerved heretofore, but alſo are renewed in the ſame ground which hath been formerly wrought. But to return.</p>
            <p>Now as theſe Subterraneal Fires are not (for reaſons aforeſaid) native to the Earth, nor are Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary <hi>in Centro Terrae,</hi> more then <hi>ſub Concavo Lunae;</hi> ſo conſequently, neither are they cauſes in general of our Hot Baths, or ſulphureous Springs; for as there are no Subterraneal Fires found either near our Hot Baths, or our Sulphur Waters; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the digging to the Source of a hot Water, by the charge and induſtry of <hi>M. de Rochas,</hi> (which in our <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi> we further inſiſt upon) where the Earth was digged beyond the original of the Waters heating, and yet not the leaſt <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of any actual or Elementary Fire, being only produced from a vivid nitrous or hermetick Salt, (as he calls it) frequently ingendred <hi>de novo,</hi> touching upon a Mineral Bed of <hi>Sulphur Vive,</hi> from whoſe mutual
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58653:59"/>contact that Hot Bath proceeded: Nay, beſides this, ſuppoſe we ſhould (for indulgence ſake) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Central or Elementary Subterraneal Fire, keept burning by a ſulphureous Matter, yet would it not even hence follow that our hot Baths or ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Matters, ſhould frequently have their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal thence; and that, firſt, becauſe ſuppoſe Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur burning actually, and that whether ſet on fire by any of the aforeſaid cauſes, or by Central Fire, or as you will, yet ſhall this Sulphur heat no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the inkindled flames reach, no more then Sulphur burning under a Glaſs Campane, (for the making its Oyl) doth heat further then the Glaſs it toucheth, ſo that the actual flame heats, but ſo doth not the fume thereof; for, ſuppoſe that the actual flames of Sulphur ſhould touch upon, and heat the Water; why might we not as eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Water to quench the Fire, as the Fire to heat the Water? Nay further, Suppoſe we ſhould grant that the flame ſhould not heat Water immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, but mediately by heating other bodies, as Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> over which the Water <hi>in cuniculis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priis</hi> paſſeth, according to <hi>Falopius,</hi> yet not a few abſurdities would hence follow; as how theſe flames ſhould burn under a Quarry of Stones, when thereby intercepted from Air (the life of Fire) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it exiſts not? Next, how theſe hot Baths ſhould then become impregnated with the medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal vertues of Sulphur, ſeeing, by this Suppoſition, the Water would want both the flame and fume of Sulphur?</p>
            <p>My ſecond Reaſon (why upon admiſſion, that though a flagrable ſulphurous matter ſhould be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the bowels of the Earth, yet ſhould it not be the cauſe of hot Baths) is, becauſe then generally
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58653:59"/>all hot Waters would have a ſtrong Brimſtone-like ſmell, like the odor of Wine or Ale matched or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Brimſtone in Bottles, or like the fumes of Sulphur which ariſe in the diſtillation of its Oil <hi>per campanam,</hi> of which ſmell, amongſt all hot Baths, I read of none which yeeld it.</p>
            <p>My third Argument is grounded upon matter of fact in this following Experiment, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Take a mineral Sulphur, whether <hi>Vive,</hi> or in a Marcaſite, (as of Vitriol <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) put it (in pieces) in an Earthen Retort, and give degrees of fire under it, in a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; where, becauſe the fire comes not actually to it, it flames not; urge this ſo, as all the Fumes (which are dry ones, called Flowers) ſhall paſs through the Neck into a Receiver, fill'd moſt-what with Water, &amp; ſo placed, as that theſe fumes all fall and condenſe upon the ſurface of the Water; which they will do in an unctuous ſubſtance like Oil of Wax or Amber, congealing by degrees, and beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming harder, they fall down to the bottom in bright flakes of Brimſtone; by which way I have got a Sulphur out of the Marcaſites of Vitriol found in the Bog near the <hi>Sulphur-Well.</hi> Now the Fire (as I ſaid) drives forth the dry fumes or flowers; theſe coming in a vapor, condenſe upon the ſurface of the Water in the Receiver; and yet (which is what I aim at) this Water hath neither taſte nor ſmell like that of our Sulphur Well at <hi>Knarsbrough.</hi> So that neither an actual or immediate firing of Sulphur, as is done in the making its Oil, nor a diſtilling or ſubliming of it by a Fire <hi>ab extra,</hi> whereby Sulphur becomes ſeparated from a Vitrioline Marcaſite, will give to Water either the like taſte or odour with the <hi>Sulphur-Well;</hi> and therefore we muſt conclude, that its faetid odour, is not cauſed from any Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58653:60"/>of burning Bitumen or Sulphur, whether ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be done in open paſſages, or cloſe Caverns of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Having thus far refuted (and that I hope demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively) the Opinions of Hot Baths and Sulphur Waters, taking their Original from imbred ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal Fires; I ſhall now propound my own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, in the fabrick of the like Waters, artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally performed in imitation of the natural. I tryed therefore whether <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> mixed with a Mineral Sulphur, and ſo diſſolv'd together in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled Water, would at all open the body of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur; into which, when filtred, I poured ſome Solution of Alom-ſtone; but it cauſed no precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nor made any diſcovery of any diſſolv'd Sulphur; alſo into a little of the clear Solution, I poured ſome Oil of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by found it raiſed a volatile Spirit out of the <hi>Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi> which would ſmite the Noſe, but perceived not the leaſt odor of Sulphur. So that I obſerved that neither <hi>Sal marine</hi> alone, or joyned with Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, nor <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> (compounded of a <hi>Sal marine</hi> and Volatile Salts) would any of them be ſufficient to open the body of Sulphur in its Mineral Marcaſites.</p>
            <p>At length, after various Experiments, I hit upon that which anſwered my expectation, and ſatisfied my curioſity; and for the further improvement of ingenuity, and as a Spur to the greater advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mechanical Experiments, ſhall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that to the World, which all the Writers of thoſe Sulphurous Waters (which I have yet met with) have been deficient in.</p>
            <p>I took therefore a pint of Spring-water, in which I diſſolv'd betwixt one and two dragms of <hi>Sal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58653:60"/>in frigido;</hi> for about that quantity the Sulphur Water contains of common Salt; into which So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Salt, in Water, I added of <hi>Calx Vive,</hi> and the Marcaſites of Vitriol, (found near the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur-Well</hi>) groſly pulveriſed, about two or three ounces, which preſently contracted a conſiderable heat; I poured off ſome of the Water, into which, filtred, I poured a little Solution of the ſimple A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom-Salt, and it immediately cauſed a precipitation of a Sulphur, and ſent forth the very ſmell; yea, had the exact taſte of the <hi>Sulphur-Well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Experiment, thus ſucceeding, gratified me for my pains in others leſs ſucceſsful; for that which I long'd to know, was, What that <hi>Menſtruum</hi> ſhould be, which might ſo open the body of Sulphur in the Marcaſites, as might render it capable of a precipitation or coagulation by another ſecond <hi>Menſtruum</hi> or Acid Liquor; ſeeing we could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine no lixivial Salts could be found in the bowels of the Earth, (which commonly is uſed for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the body of Sulphur); Therefore I thought it might poſſibly be from ſome natural <hi>Calx Vive,</hi> ſeeing there are plenty of Lime-ſtones upon that Forreſt, which at <hi>Knarsbrough</hi> are burnt in Pits; and ſo it proved, for the Salt-Water paſſing through ſome natural Stone, or ſoft Marcaſite of <hi>Calx Vive,</hi> becomes acuated thereby; and then running over the Vitrioline Marcaſites, or paſſing through a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Earth, congeneal to thoſe Marcaſites, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the body of their Embryonative Sulphur, which it carries along with it, till it come on further to an Alom-Bed (which I obſerved to be within ten yards of the breaking forth of that <hi>Spaw</hi>) where the acid Juyce precipitates the Sulphur, and ſends
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58653:61"/>forth the odour; which being percolated through a ſtreiner of Sand, comes forth pretty clear.</p>
            <p>That this Artificial Water is an exact reſemblance and imitation of the natural, is evident, becauſe it anſwers the natural in every circumſtance; for it hath the very ſmell and taſte, undergoes the very ſame precipitations by lixivial Liquors; yea, and laſtly, tingeth Silver yellow, as readily as the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur-Well;</hi> and therefore, without doubt, the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Artificial would be found (upon tryal) equivalent to the Natural in other properties alſo.</p>
            <p>The main Objection that offers it ſelf againſt the identity or ſimilarneſs of this Artificial, with the Natural Sulphur Water, is by querying how <hi>Calx Vive,</hi> which is an artificial product of the Fire, actually calcining thoſe Lime-ſtones, ſhould be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be naturally in the Earth, or how Nature ſhould find ſuch a Stone calcined to its hand, in the Entrals of the Earth, as may be ſufficient to open the body of theſe ſulphurous Marcaſites.</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, That it's more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there is a natural ſoft Stone of <hi>Calx Vive,</hi> where this Marcaſite is <hi>in ſucco primitivo,</hi> retaining the ſame Seminals and eſſential Properties, in a remiſs degree, with that Stone brought on to maturity by Air and Fire; for the Air firſt hardens that Stone, (and makes it unfit to give any Solution in Water) and then the actual Fire looſneth it, and makes it yeeld it ſelf more readily to a Solution by moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate which, we can as eaſily apprehend that the Air doth harden theſe natural Lime-ſtones (which, while ſucculent, are ſoft, and in the form of a white Earth or Marl) by its continual acceſs
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58653:61"/>in a long tract of time; as we can imagine the ſame Air to harden a blew Clay, found upon the Banks in <hi>Lincolnſhire;</hi> which being expoſed to the Air, doth, in continuance of time, harden into a ſort of Stone like a blew Marble. For Workmen gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally obſerve, that all manner of Stone (yea even Marble it ſelf) which they dig out of the Ground, becomes more and more hard, by being long expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Air; which, to me, ſeems to give no ſmall grounds of reaſon for the poſſibility of the Liquor Alkaheſt, or Univerſal Solvent; for ſeeing all bodies are but concretions, and (as I may ſay) hardnings of their primitive Juyces, under various diſguiſes, generally performed by the efficiency of Air: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prepare a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> by Art, which may work wonders in this kind, is no more (as I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend) then to make ſuch a one as may ſoften theſe Concretions, (made by Air) and by taking away their hardneſs, may reduce bodies into their firſt jucy Liquors; for what is the ſhell of an Egg, but a ſoft film or membrane, hardned and petrified by the influence of the Air, and as eaſily reduceable into its firſt membranous ſoftneſs, by being boyled a while in Vinegar? What are the Bones of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, but Spermatick Juyces hardned and conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated? And were it not for the perpetual circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Juyces of the body, conſtantly tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring through the pores thereof, we ſhould either become petrified, and walk about like ſo many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, but ſenſleſs Statues; or we ſhould be incircled with a Bark, and appear like ſo many Plant-Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, or ſenſitive Plants. What are all Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles from the Hyſop or Roſemary of the Wall, to the talleſt Cedar, but ſeminal Juyces congealed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe bulky ſubſtances which are preſented to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58653:62"/>our eye? Laſtly, What are all Mineral and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calline Marcaſites, Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the primitive liquid ſucculencies concreted into more ſolid bodies by a hardning ferment (or what other name we may call it by) aequipollent to the Air?</p>
            <p>And amongſt all theſe, what are the Marcaſites of Lime-ſtone, but a hardned concretion of its firſt imbred Juyce, or ſoft marly Earth? whoſe <hi>Minera,</hi> whilſt thus <hi>in ſolutis principiis,</hi> is one of the chiefeſt Juyces in the Fabrick, both of hot Baths and ſulphureous Waters.</p>
            <p>That this is the chief cauſe of hot Baths, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that Experiment made by that Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> of a piece of a white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſite found about the place of thoſe hot Springs in <hi>Sommerſetſhire,</hi> which put into Water, gives a heat; not but that there may be other cauſes of hot Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as from the coincidence of two Springs impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with different Mineral Salts and Juyces, which before union are probably both actually cold, and yet by a fermentation cauſed by their mutual contact, may cauſe a conſiderable heat; which can no better be reſembled, then by ſuppoſing a current of Water, indued with a lix vial or vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt, to meet another ſaturated with an eſurine acid Spirit or Salt; though theſe before union are both actually cold, yet forthwith, upon their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual contact, they make a ſtrong ebullition and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, which produceth a heat ſufficient to warm thoſe Liquors, which are, or paſs through where the conteſt is made; not to ſay that an other cauſe of ſome hot Baths, may be from ſome Marca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites contracting a heat by moiſture, let into their <hi>Minera</hi> by ſome crevices of the Earth, which may give heat to ſome Springs that paſs over them, nor
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58653:62"/>to inſiſt upon any other cauſe <hi>(viz.)</hi> of ſome Salts, which in the <hi>Minera</hi> of Sulphur, may cauſe ſuch a fermentation, as may cauſe hot Springs; witneſs Dr. <hi>Rech.</hi> his Experiment.</p>
            <p>Yea, that this natural Lime-ſtone may be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt the chief cauſes of hot Baths, is further confirmed by a lixivial Salt, (though ſmall in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity) which I have, by evaporation of <hi>Buxton</hi> hot Water, found left behind: that it is an alkalizate or lixivial Salt, appears both by its ſalty taſte, its eaſie ſolution <hi>per deliquium;</hi> and laſtly, The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition it makes with an acid Spirit; all which are demonſtrative Arguments of its alkalizate nature: for <hi>Buxton</hi> Bath conſiſts of Water, which by diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ariſeth inſipid over the Helm, and therefore contains no volatile Minerals, and of an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantity of a ſolution of the Alkali of the natural Lime-ſtone, (where plenty of the Lime-ſtone hardned by the Air, is found in the Countrey thereabouts).</p>
            <p>And that this <hi>Minera</hi> of <hi>Calx Vive,</hi> is the chief (if not the ſole) apperient, that opens the body of Sulphur in its <hi>Minera,</hi> for the making ſulphurous Waters, is evident from our lately propoſed Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for all ſulphureous Waters (as I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) are either ſuch as have a ſulphureous or bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous matter ſwimming upon them, (witneſs the inſtance aforeſaid) or they are ſuch whoſe bodies being opened by proper Solvents, do then eaſily give forth their volatile odors and ſapors to Water, which may be made evident by the addition of acid Salt or Liquor.</p>
            <p>And now that we have found out what the firſt Menſtruum is, which opens the body of Sulphur in the Marcaſites found near the Sulphur Well; Let
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58653:63"/>us now conſider what theſe Marcaſites are, I find them to be a ſpongy or porous Stone, hard, and wrought with a kind of Net-work, which in it ſelf contains both Vitriol and Sulphur, beſides a body of Colcothar; and that it doth ſo, appears by expoſing ſome of theſe Marcaſites to the Air, till they be covered with a hoary ſweet vitrioline Floſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, which then being waſhed, gives a vitrioline Solution, that being filtred and evaporated to a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, ſhoots into a green Vitriol.</p>
            <p>Theſe Marcaſites, thus waſhed, we ſet before the fire to dry ſo long, till they began to ſend forth a ſulphurous fume; then being pounded groſly, we diſtilled, or rather ſublimed them in an Earthen Retort; what would ariſe by degrees of fire, we ſo placed a Receiver, with Water in it, as that the fumes were thrown upon the ſurface thereof, which firſt ſwam like Oil upon the Water, then by degrees hardening, fell down to the bottom; which when the ſublimation was over, we waſhed, dryed, and then melted it, and in ſmall lead Pipes caſt it into Magdaleons; in colour and inflammabity, exactly reſembling the common Sulphur, of which at one diſtillation I got near half a pound.</p>
            <p>That they contain a Colcothar or Metalline <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> is evident, by burning the Sulphur of one of theſe Stones in the fire; and when cold, it will be red juſt like the Colcothar of the Vitriol of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> left after the ſublimation of the Sulphur from the Marcaſites, is very like thoſe Cinders, or <hi>Scoria</hi> of Iron, which is melted from the Iron-Maſs in the Forge, where Iron is made out of its <hi>Minera.</hi>

            <p> From what hath been already ſaid, there ſeems to be no ſmall incouragement towards proſecuting a further diſcovery of the nature of this Water, by digging the Spring, and following it to the fource, or original, where it receives the firſt impregnation with Sulphur; for I ſee nothing yet to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that may perſwade, why it ſhould not be found to be a hot Spring at that place where the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibition of Sulphur is, eſpecially if the <hi>ſuccus La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>And as Dr. <hi>Jordan</hi> ſaith, That all hot Waters are not Sulphurous, witneſs the Baths of <hi>Caldenella</hi> and <hi>Avenian, &amp;c.</hi> which are all hot, and yet give no ſign of Sulphur, proceeding rather from the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera</hi> of <hi>Calx Vive,</hi> or from other the like cauſes of hot Waters, as aforeſaid; nor are all ſulphurous Waters hot, and that becauſe of the diſtance of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58653:64"/>
               <hi>Minera,</hi> where the Water firſt receives heat from the eruption of the Spring-head.</p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe ſulphurous Springs, as ſome are repleniſhed with a common Foſſil Salt; witneſs the <hi>Sulphur-Well</hi> we diſcourſe of: So there are found others no leſs ſulphurous in taſte and ſmell, which yet have not the leaſt <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of any ſuch Salt; for inſtance, One of the Springs which is in the black Bog, where the Marcaſites are got; and one at <hi>Braughton,</hi> not far from <hi>Skipton</hi> in <hi>Craven;</hi> as alſo one I found in <hi>Ferndale</hi> upon <hi>Blacomore;</hi> all which are cauſed by a combination of a mineral Sulphur and a natural Lime-ſtone, the one open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body of the other, without the addition of any common Salt; onely theſe Springs having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed theſe Minerals, meeting afterwards with an acid Juyce of the Alom-Salt, make a precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body of Sulphur, and onely leaves the Water perfumed with the odor thereof.</p>
            <p>That this Sulphur Water ſhould coagulate Milk, if boyled therewith, proceeds from a ſleight touch of the acid Juyce of Alom; which although in the coagulation of the Sulphur, it alſo precipitates a great part of its own body, yet ſo much thereof remains, as doth make it capable of curdling Milk; for the Sulphur doth not, in as much as it retains that coagulating property, after the ſulphurous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour being evaporated; yea, the very Salt left after diſtillation or evaporation will do the ſame; nor may the common Salt, (the chief Ingredient of that Water) do it, becauſe we ſee the contrary in putting Salt to Water and Milk, which doth not curdle it; therefore it muſt be from ſome ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibition of the Alom-Salt, which yet is ſo little in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58653:64"/>quantity, as doth not alter the cubical figure of the common Salt.</p>
            <p>And to try whether we could ſeparate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt, from the body of the Sulphur Water, and the Water only to retain the odour thereof; I took of the ſandy Earth, which lies upon the Bank oppoſite to the Well; wherewith I cauſed a tap'd Veſſel to be filled, upon which I ordered the Sulphur Water to be poured; and about two hours and a half after, (during which time I was digging in the Bog above) I cauſed ſome of it to be let forth at the Tap into a Glaſs, and found its brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs not only much diminiſhed, but that alſo it loſt its ſulphurous odor quite, having not the leaſt ſmell or taſte thereof.</p>
            <p>From which experiment may probably be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed theſe two Suppoſitions; firſt, That the breaking forth of this Spring, is not far from the place of its imbibed Minerals; for although it be ſo far, as the firſt contracted heat is loſt in its paſſage, yet it's not ſo far, but that it retains its odor after the precipitation of the moſt part of the Sulphur, by the acid aluminous Juyce. Next, That if this Sulphur Water had been carried through a longer tract of a ſuppoſed Strainer, before its eruption, it would not only have been diminiſhed in its Salt, but alſo its ſulphurous odor would have been very weak, if not wholly ſpent.</p>
            <p>That the Earth, about the Sulphur Well, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with variety of Mineral Glebes, is evident from the diverſity of Waters found thereabouts; for near the Sulphur-Well, there is not more then ten or twelve yeards diſtant, (upon the Banck on the other ſide of the current of Water) a Spring which drills out of a ſmall Alom Rock, which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58653:65"/>leaves a red Sediment behind it, and runs forth with ſo great a diſadvantage, as to the ſaving any of it clear, that I could not (that little time I had to ſtay) procure any clear Water to make tryal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but it promiſeth much for an Alom <hi>Spaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the black Bog, about two hundred and forty yards above the head of this Well, where the Marcaſites are chiefly found, are ſeveral ſlow Springs, all which I have cauſed to be digged fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that which lies on the North ſide of the Bog, is that which the Water-women call (improperly) an <hi>Alom-Water;</hi> this, with a little Gall, ſtrikes a deep purple, and in taſte is very ſtrong of the Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Marcaſites; yea, the moſt of the Earth digged up, is Vitrioline.</p>
            <p>That Spring towards the Weſt, hath a both ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous odor and taſte alſo, but not very brackiſh; this I cauſed to be digged a little depth, to find out the Marcaſites; where we found many little metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Stones, perforated and corroded into Shells or Scales, and worn (as I may ſay) into Sceletons: I found in the Earth, lying along the current of the Spring, a bright Floſcule, which runs in ſtreaks very thin, and almoſt impalpable; which lay much in Veins; I look upon it as a crude mercurial Juyce, which with its connate embryonative Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, was as a Seed, laying a foundation for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or metalline production; the Spring, by dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, proved more large and fluent; the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, was a black ſoft marly Ground, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous, and appeared as if it were much impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Mineral Juyces; the Earth grained, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and burnt, gives a Brimſtone-like ſmell. Thoſe Marcaſites we found, were below the current of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58653:65"/>the Spring; and therefore it's likely that Water had not penetrated them, for it gave no tincture with Galls.</p>
            <p>The Spring towards the South, had plenty of a black ſpongy Marcaſite, out of which we took ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pieces; yea, all about that place is full thereof round about the ſides, and in one place, where the Air had wrought upon the Marcaſite, it did ſhoot, by the heat of the Sun, into green Chryſtals like Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol; as indeed being nothing but Vitriol it ſelf, of which I have ſome by me: The Water that ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates there (for it hath no current) will with Galls give a deep purple tincture, being very acid in taſte, and ſo undergoes the other mutation of colours like other Vitrioline Waters.</p>
            <p>And now I have ſhown, how Mineral Juyces, by their coincidence and mutual contact, with their various fermentations, become the original effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of Hot Baths and Sulphurous Waters, in the ſecret Meanders of the Earth, where Metals and Minerals are <hi>in ſolutis principiis,</hi> in their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſpermatick Juyces, from whence proceeds the great variety of taſtes, ſmells, alterations of colours, fermentations, and different operations of all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters; and as theſe are the true cauſes, from whence the moſt natural <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Concrets, peculiarly belonging to the Mineral Kingdom, are deducible; ſo in like manner, the various fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Juyces, which circulate in the Channels of the bodies of Animals and Vegetables, are the cauſes of thoſe manifold <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> proper and incident to all Concrets belonging thereto.</p>
            <p>For what is Heat, Fermentation, Motion, Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with all the concomitants thereof, but products from the coincidence and combination of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58653:66"/>Seminal, with adventitious Juyces of the bodies of Animals? What are the Juyces of the Body, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing various fermentations, but ſuch as thereby are made capable (by a natural ſymetry) of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the functions of Life? And what are the acid Juyces, ſcituate in their proper places, but actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ferments, which macerate, prepare, diſſolve, and digeſt the food we take in; which being altered by its paſſage through other ſubſequent ferments, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes various tranſmutations and diverſifications, which ſucceeding in a conſtant circulation, upholds the fabrick of the body? Doth not the natural heat of the body, proceed from a due fermentation of the Juyces? as when the nutritive Juyce undergoes ſuch alterations, by praevious preparations; as when in the form of a milky Liquor, it coincides with the blood in the ſubclavial Veſſels; and both carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Vaena Cava</hi> into the Heart, doth there ſtrike up a vital heat in the taper of life, (the vital Spirits) but if it come raw, for want of a due preparation, by a defect of previous ferments, then it produceth a ſpurious febrile heat, which rather diſſipates the natural heat, and deſtroyes (then binds up) the right tone and texture of the parts. And laſtly, Doth not the acid Juyce of the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſion of the Stomach, diſſolve (looſening the <hi>Vinculum</hi> of) our nutritive Juyce, and ſo open the body thereof, as to make it become one ſimilar milky Cremer? and doth not this diſſolv'd and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened Chyle, receive a ſecond <hi>Menſtruum</hi> coming from the Gaul (that Balſam of the Body) by the <hi>ductus communis,</hi> inſerted into the <hi>duodenum,</hi> and there (beſides the periſtaltick motion it gives to the inteſtines) in part precipitates the opened body of the Sulphur of the nutritive Juyce, and cauſeth a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58653:66"/>volatile faetid flatus peculiar to thoſe parts, which not finding vent <hi>per inferiora,</hi> ſometimes works into the Stomach, and (by the mediation of the Nerves of the ſixth conjugation) into the Head, and other parts; is not this faetid flatus (native to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines) cauſed by a commixture of a ſaline Ferment diſmis'd (I ſay) from the Gaul, which precipitates the opened body of the Sulphur in our nutritive Juyce, which before ſuch precipitation, is a ſimilar Cremor?</p>
            <p>And to conclude; is not the growth, budding, hearing, and ſpecifical endowments of Vegetables, the product of fermenting Juyces? And is not the changing of Fruits by grafting and inoculating one ſort into another (as that a pleaſant Apple ſhould grow from a Crab-ſtock, and a Pear from a Thorn) cauſed otherwiſe then by different fermentations, and ſpecifications of the nutritive Juyce, which no ſooner undergoes any different ferments, or paſſeth various Strainers, but forthwith becomes metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed thereby; ſo that the metaſtaſis of all bodies in the whole triplicity of nature, depends upon the variety of fermenting Juyces, and their mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, implanted in the Seminal Principles of all Concretes.</p>
            <p>But to return, to treat a little of another Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of this Well, and that is <hi>Sal marine,</hi> or Foſſil Salt, both are one, that of the Sea having its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal (according to all probability) from Foſſil Salt; concerning which, I find my Antagoniſt, <hi>p.</hi> 119.122. of his <hi>Mimick,</hi> about to impeach me of two Contradictions; the firſt is, in that I ſay, The ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sea proceeds from Foſſil Salt, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolv'd in Water, is carried into the Ocean, and yet maintains a circulation of the Sea-Water,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58653:67"/>from the Sea, to the heads of Springs by Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Channels: Now the force of the Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he ſuppoſeth, lieth in this; that he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that I would aſſert that the ſame Channels ſhould convey a Salt into the Sea, and alſo convey the Sea-Water to the Springs, two contrary Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the ſame Channels.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That there is no need (in that Hypotheſis of the Springs, having their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the Sea, and the Sea's having its ſaltneſs from the Earth) to aſſert two contrary Currents in the ſame Channels; and that, firſt, becauſe of ſome Rocks and Bodies of Salt which are often found in the Sea; and next, becauſe of the ſaltneſs, diſperſed throughout the whole body of the Earth, eaſily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed by Waters, (as the Learned Dr. <hi>Highmore</hi> notes upon the Controverſie, <hi>Philoſophical Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, Numb.</hi> 56. <hi>P.</hi> 1129, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and may as eaſily be conveighed into the Sea by Subterraneal Channels, paſſing through Salt Beds, in their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from one Sea to another; which Subterraneal Channels (by which Seas communicate) we have demonſtratively illuſtrated in the Appendix to our <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi> p. 307, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I find my Antagoniſt taking ſanctuary at his wonted Aſylum of Putationary Philoſophy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in with his, I do verily think that all the Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil Salt in the body of the Earth, (which we ſee is very rarely found) if it were diſſolved, would not ſerve to ſupply a twentieth part of the Salt that is in the Sea; whom I anſwer, That ſurely he is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant, or at leaſt oblivious of what is writ concerning Rocks of Salt in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in <hi>Monte Carpato,</hi> in <hi>Polonia,</hi> within two miles of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> in <hi>Helvetia</hi> and <hi>Rhetia,</hi> where they have no other
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58653:67"/>Salt but from the Rock; as alſo by the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Straights are great Rocks of Salt; there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo many Rivers of Salt Water by the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Straights, and in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Caria,</hi> and in <hi>Bactria, Ochus</hi> and <hi>Oxius;</hi> alſo there are Salt Lakes, as the <hi>Tarentine</hi> Lakes in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Lake between <hi>Strapela</hi> and <hi>Seburg;</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> three Lakes; in <hi>Sicily,</hi> (and beſides an infinite number in other Countries) the Lake of Lakes, the Sea, all which (as Dr. <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> ſaith) receive their ſaltneſs from Mines of Salt in the Earth, which are very frequent and huge in bigneſs, as may appear by the foreſaid Rocks of Salt; Yea, <hi>Marcus Paulus Venetus</hi> tells of a Rock or Mountain of Salt in <hi>Thaican,</hi> able to furniſh all the World with Salt: So that it is no marvel (ſaith the ingenious Dr. <hi>Jorden</hi>) that the Sea is ſalt ſeeing it pierceth into the bowels of the Earth, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth many great Rocks of Salt which diſſolve in it; and this is the true cauſe (ſaith he) of the ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sea. What is premiſed, will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (without any more adoe) to take off his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of a ſecond Contradiction, (<hi>p.</hi> 122.) in that I ſay, in one place the <hi>Sulphur-Well</hi> at <hi>Knarsbrough</hi> is ſaturated from Foſſil Salt; and in another place, that <hi>Sal marine</hi> is the cauſe of that Sulphureous Spring, ſeeing it is evident (as alſo witneſſeth the learned Dr. <hi>Highmore</hi>) that the Salt of Sea-Water and Salt-Springs are the ſame with Foſſil Salt; his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the Seas having its ſaltneſs from Foſſil Salt, is frivolous, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That it ſhould (if made by Foſſil Salt) kill all Fiſh, as well Sea-Fiſh as Freſh-Fiſh; for ſo (ſaith he) Salt put to freſh Water doth; which is even as true, as that Fiſh ſhould, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept over-night in a clean Copper Veſſel with the Water they ſwim in, be found dead the next
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58653:68"/>morning, by the mortal Steam or Vapour of the Copper; both which are found falſe by matter of fact, the one by that Experiment I made of Fiſh, which not only out-lived one, but two nights in a Braſs Pan; the other by that Experiment of Oyſters made by Dr. <hi>Highmore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now conclude with the addition of a few Mechanical Experiments made upon this <hi>Sulphur-Water,</hi> thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt, It takes no purple or red tincture from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Galls, as having nothing of the praecipitable parts of Vitriol or Alom; Oil of Tartar being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it becomes muddied into a white curdled Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; and with Oil of Vitriol, or Oil of Sulphur, it becomes clear again; but with freſh Oil of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, it is preſently turn'd to a colour inclining to a red; and with the addition of more Oil of Vitriol, or ſuch like, it becomes tranſparent, and of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Sack, or Engliſh Beer.</p>
            <p>If upon freſh Sulphur-Water, Oil of Vitriol be poured, it makes neither a precipitation, nor any other alteration, and that becauſe of a praevious ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation with an aluminous acidity; but by adding Oil of Tartar thereunto, and after that Galls, then follows an efferveſcence, and it becomes of a reddiſh colour.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, By the addition of Oil of Tartar, this Sulphur-Water turns white, and that becauſe it is impregnated with a ſmall quantity of the ſimple na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Alom-Salt.</p>

            <p>Theſe Queries I ſhall (by the help of a few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments) indeavour to reſolve. As to the firſt therefore I conclude in the Negative, for I have diſtilled the <hi>Spaw-Waters</hi> of <hi>Scarbrough</hi> and <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> the <hi>Sweet</hi> as well as the <hi>Sulphur-Water</hi> at <hi>Knarsbrough, &amp;c.</hi> none of which ever did yeeld either a vinous or acid, or any other ſort of Spirits that are either inflammable or uninflammable.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond I anſwer in the Aſſirmative, as to the firſt part thereof; to confirm which, and to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the reſt of the Queries with the light of truth, I ſhall propound two or three conſiderable Experiments.</p>
            <pb n="122" facs="tcp:58653:70"/>
            <p> Firſt, Therefore I adviſed my ingenious Friend to ſet by a certain quantity of <hi>Scarbrough-Spaw-Water,</hi> in an open Veſſel, and found thereby that it did precipitate its Earth or Sediment in about forty eight hours, ſo that it would not give a tincture with Galls.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another quantity of <hi>Spaw-Water</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet by at the ſame time with the former, but in a Glaſs Bottle ſo cloſe ſtopt, that neitheir Air could come in, nor ought evaporate; and being opened, when the other ceaſed to give a tincture, this did yet ſtrike a tincture, but within leſs then twelve hours after, it alſo would give none.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A Glaſs Bottle, and an Egg-Glaſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with the <hi>Spaw-Water,</hi> the firſt exactly ſtopt, the other hermetically ſealed, being both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly weighed and ſet by, with an other Glaſs fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and weighed, but unſtopt, at the end of ſix weeks, the ſtopt Bottle could not be diſcerned to be heavier or lighter, being weighed again after the foreſaid time; nor could it be perceived that any Sediment was fallen, becauſe it gave as perfect a tincture with Galls, as Water freſh from the <hi>Spaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which it appears, that the ſecond Query is thus far true, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe Mineral Waters, when moſt cloſely ſtopt, and ſo let ſtand, do not let fall a Sediment; but if they do let fall their Ocre to the bottom, (as in open Glaſſes we find they do) then is this Sediment moſt-what of a yellow colour, and the Waters become effaete, as to their ſolutive Operations.</p>
            <p>The third is anſwered in the Negative; for being let ſtand, and not moved by carriage, they do not (ſuppoſing they be ſtopt) ſooner precipitate an Ocre
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58653:70"/>to the bottom, nor ſooner become caſtrated thereby; witneſs the third Experiment, where, in a ſtopt Glaſs, after ſix weeks time, no Sediment was fallen.</p>
            <p>The fourth Query is found true in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, by the common Obſervations of thoſe who view varieties of <hi>Spaws,</hi> for they precipitate their Ocre both at the Spring-head, as alſo in their Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent (for ſome diſtance) <hi>ſub dio,</hi> but chiefly at the Spring-head; for whilſt they are kept from the open Air, though their Channels under-ground ſhould be ſtretched out much longer, yet would they not let fall their Sediment; by which it appears how great an influence the open Air hath upon the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mineral-Waters, as well as upon other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>The fifth Query is ſolv'd by our Experiments thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That two Bottles of the ſaid Water, whereof the one being induſtriouſly ſtopped, the other left unſtopt, and both equally permitted to ſtand ſtill, do not equally loſe their vertues medical, in the ſame ſpace of time, nor have the ſame precipitated Sediment, and conſequently are not of the ſame taſte, colour, nor alike diminiſht in quantity.</p>
            <p>The ſixth Query is involv'd in the fifth, only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing that the ſtopt Veſſel be of ſuch a figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or texture of parts, as may exclude the ambient Air, and then all ſucceeds as in the fifth.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh is ſolv'd thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe Waters being cloſed up either in Glaſſes exactly ſtopt, or hermetically ſealed, and kept from motion, do prevent all precipitation of a Sediment in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and this is confirmed by the third Experiment, where the Water was kept, hermetically ſealed, for ſix weeks, without any precipitation; yea, the ſame is confirmed not onely in theſe Mineral Medicinal
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58653:71"/>Waters, but even in more ordinary Spring-Waters, whoſe Sediments, or what elſe they have imbibed of Mineral Earth, will eaſily precipitate, by being expoſed in open Veſſels to the Air, or by being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled, will leave behind their Sediments; whereas I found the very ſame, taken freſh from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which I have kept hermetically ſealed for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three months, not to give any the leaſt precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or alteration of colour, which (for ought I know) may not only keep ſo unaltered for months, but alſo for years; which very experiment is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable towards a further improvement of Philoſophy, and amongſt other Phaenomena, which I ſhall not now take time to inſiſt upon; that of blood extravaſated by Phlebotomy, and a while ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in open Veſſels to the Air, doth receive no ſmal alteration therefrom, making it ſeparate into ſuch heterogenious parts, as are not pre-exiſtent in it, whilſt running in the Veſſels, and therefore doth not a little deceive thoſe Phyſitians who judge of the temperature of the Blood, and of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy of this or the other Humour, from a proſpect of the extravaſated Blood, ſeparated by an exotick ferment of the Air, into Water, Phlegm, or white Gelly, or black congealed Blood; when (perhaps) that Blood, whilſt in the Body, and (as I may ſay) hermetically ſealed up in the natural Veſſels, was ſimilar in its parts; which (if enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with due fermentations and ſeparations in the Organical Parts) would throw off all Scorbutick, Venereal, or other Miaſms and Impurities, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate in the form of a pure homogenial rubicund Juyce: to confirm which, I would propound one or two Queries, the reſolution of which will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly put the matter beyond diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58653:71"/>ſuppoſe ſome few ounces of blood ſhould be taken from a found (or if you will, from an unhealthful) Perſon, and by a Silver Syphon be conveyed part into a clean Glaſs, firſt warmed, and whilſt warm, be ſealed up hermetically, and ſo ſet in a continued gentle heat; whilſt preſently an other part of the ſame is conveyed, in like manner, into a cold Glaſs, and ſo preſently ſealed up as aforeſaid, but ſet by in a cold place; whether, I ſay, hereby it will be found, that the blood (in one, or both, or neither) will keep its priſtine form it had, whilſt circulating in the Veſſels, or whilſt tranſmitted from one Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to the other? and whether hereby it may not be preſerved in its entire form, not onely for one, or two, but for many months, yea perhaps year; and whether it will keep its form better in that Glaſs expoſed to the cold, or ſet in a gentle (as it were an) animal warmth? and laſtly, whether that ſet in heat may not, by continuance of time, be gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to ſo high an elixerated Liquor, as that hereby it may be made capable, not onely of preſerving it ſelf alterwards from the injury of a ſeparating fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Air, but alſo may become as a fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Balſam, able, if given inwardly (or at leaſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly applyed) to preſerve the ſimilar Blood it meets with, from all inſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="126" facs="tcp:58653:72"/>
            <p> The eighth Query I thus ſolve, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That in my Tryals and Obſervations of Mineral Waters, I always found that no ſooner was the Ocre or Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment precipitated, but they both loſe their tinging property with Galls, as alſo their purging faculty; and that though the Salts which had diſſolv'd theſe <hi>ramenta ferrea,</hi> were left yet diſſolv'd in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (after the ſeparation of the Ocre by motion, heat, or air) notwithſtanding which, the Waters are found to have no force in their purging Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by how much the more this is precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (even till it be all fallen) by ſo much the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are weaker and weaker in their Operation.</p>
            <p>To the ninth, or laſt Query, I thus anſwer, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That by what is premiſed, it muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the <hi>Phenomenon</hi> of loſs of Vertues in ſuch Waters, may by an Hypotheſis of an inteſtine precipitation of their parts wherein thoſe vertues conſiſted, be much better, and more truly explicated, then by the Hypotheſis of an avolation of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts, through all Veſſels and Cloſures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>By this time, theſe things duly weighed, in the opinion of all judicious Perſons, (who ground Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the infallible Criterion of Luciferous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments) I may well ſuppoſe the Spirits in the <hi>Scarbrough</hi> and <hi>Kuar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And hence it is evident why Dr. <hi>French</hi> came to be miſtaken, who ſuppoſing Volatile Mineral Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to be in the <hi>Knarsbrough Spaw-Water,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring by diſtiliation (in a Glaſs-Still, whoſe Joynts were luted and cloſed up carefully) to get
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58653:72"/>their Spirits, failed not onely in his expectation of catching them, but alſo found that the firſt two ſpoonfuls which were diſtilled; yea, and the reſt undiſtilled that remained, utterly loſt both the taſte and odour which they had before; neither would they become any otherwiſe tinged with Galls, then common Spring-Water: who not eaſily conſcious of his Error, imputes the loſs of thoſe Spirits to their ſubtilty, imagining them ſo volatile, as to penetrate even the Glaſs it ſelf, or the Lute, neither of which (he judgeth) could hold them; not recollecting, that no ſooner doth heat work upon Mineral Waters, but preſently it cauſeth ſuch an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the texture of their parts, as that forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Mineral Ocre precipitates to the bottom, leaving both what is diſtilled, and what is undiſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led void of tincture, and moſt-what effaete in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and that not from the avolation of Spirits, but from an inteſtine precipitation of parts, as is evinced beyond diſpute by our former Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Theſe Waters do not only (being her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically ſealed) keep their vertues and tinging qualities, but alſo are not impaired in their quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and weight, being found (after ſix weeks inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure under the hermetick Seal) neither heavier nor lighter; and now I give room for the World to judge, Whether the authority of my Antagoniſt be Authentick, and whether or no he hath done well to impoſe both upon himſelf and others in the delivery of theſe words, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the <hi>Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough Waters</hi> loſe all their vertue, yea, their quantity and bulk alſo, though in Glaſſes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hermetick Seal, if removed from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-head, and then they become ſuddenly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58653:73"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doubtleſs through the loſs of Volatile Spirits: he ſpeaks this ſo confidently, as if he had had it from the Oracle of Experience, whereas he never took the pains to make any ſatisfactory Eſſayes therein.</p>
            <p>From what is premiſed, may naturally ariſe theſe following ſhort Corolaries.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Mineral. Waters operate and give their uſual <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> by a due contemperature of their Mineral Ingredients.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That amongſt theſe, (if eſpecially the Mineral Ocre becomes once precipitated) the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters loſe their purging Vertues and tinging Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, So long as theſe can (either by Nature or Art) be kept from precipitation, ſo long theſe Waters retain their proper Vertues.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That to facilitate (or indeed cauſe) that theſe Waters ſhould precipitate their Mineral Ocre, is required one of theſe three, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Heat, or Air; by Motion, I mean that <hi>ab extra,</hi> for otherwiſe what Heat and Air perform, is by the medium of Motion; for Heat, or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to the open Air, or a quaſſation of parts by motion, doth make ſuch an alteration in the texture of theſe Mineral Waters, as they preſently thereby let fall their contained Mineral Earth.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Theſe three being ſecluded from having any power over them, they (<hi>viz.</hi> the Waters) may continue their Vertues, Weight, tinging Qualities, Colours, and other conſequent <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> for ſome months (yea probably for years) unalterd.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That to have recourſe to a ſort of Spirits (which are not <hi>inrerum naturâ</hi>) for ſolving thoſe <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> better (and perhaps onely) ſolvable
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58653:73"/>by an inteſtine alteration and precipitation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Ingredients, will argue no leſs then an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon our imaginations, by a kind of cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faſcination.</p>
            <p>But here I am to advertiſe my Reader, That ſince I committed theſe Papers to the Preſs, I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely had ſome diſcourſe with the aforeſaid Dr. <hi>Foot,</hi> concerning his Queries afore-mentioned. Whereupon we mutually agreed, That my Return to the Queries, together with the Experiments, confirming as well as elucidating the ſame, do chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate to the Mineral Medical Waters, which are of that Claſs or ſort, which do purge by Stool moſtly, and alſo by Urine; ſuch are the <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough-Spaw, Barnet</hi> and <hi>Epſham</hi>-Waters, and divers others the like, which are Aluminous, and work by Siedge. But that the <hi>Tunbridge</hi>-Waters, (concerning which he principally propoſed his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) and alſo (perhaps) the <hi>Aſtrap,</hi> and <hi>Stall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>-Waters, together with all ſuch as work moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what by Urine, ought to have a ſomewhat different conſideration; eſpecially in the point of loſing their Medical Vertues, though they be veſſell'd up with all due and needful circumſtances, and cloſed and ſealed up with all imaginable Art, care, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; yea, although they are not in the leaſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards moved, heated, or expoſed to the Air; and conſequently, that theſe cloſe Circumſtances, in veſſelling up, and ſtopping in the <hi>Tunbridg</hi>-Waters, and ſuch like, will not prevent this depauperation or amiſſion of their Medical Vertues; as otherwiſe may be done with the <hi>Scarbrough,</hi> and all ſuch like <hi>Spaws:</hi> but as to all the other matters almoſt, both in the Queries, and this Anſwer to them, they ſeem to be applicable indifferently enough to both
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58653:74"/>the ſorts of the fore-cited Medicinal Waters. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, Reader, The Doctor did thank me for my Return to his Queries, though he (frankly) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to me, he ſuppoſed my Anſwer to be inappoſite only to that point afore-noted, by reaſon of my being (at the writing my Return) a perfect ſtranger to the <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> or any other Waters of the like properties: but further added, That he hoped my Example would be a motive to others, (whoſe abilities and opportunities amply capacitate them thereunto) both from Reaſon and Experiment conjoyntly, to acquaint the World with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and uſefulneſs of all ſorts of Medical Waters, which Nature hath prepared by her Chymiſtry, or rather the God of Nature hath bountifully beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Mankind for its relief and comfort.</p>

               <hi>THE Epilogue, or Concluſion, BEING</hi> Some Reflections upon the moſt material Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and conſiderable Experiments, in a late Treatiſe writ by Dr. <hi>Tunſtal,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Scarbrough-Spaw,</hi> being an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract thereof, with a return thereto: where a way is propounded for preventing all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies which may happen to thoſe who drink of the <hi>Scarbrough-Spaw.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BY that time I had finiſhed the fore-going Sheets of this ſecond Piece, I met with a Book written upon the ſame Subject, by an other Chymical Phyſitian; which coming ſo opportunely to my hand, before the concluſion of the whole, I could not let ſlip ſome reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt remarkable paſſages thereof; and that, firſt, becauſe I find him in his <hi>Chymical Analyſis</hi> of this Water, to joyn iſſue with me in the main, by finding out and aſſerting the ſame true eſſential conſtitutive Principles thereof; next, becauſe I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him impeaching this <hi>Spaw</hi>-Water of the grand crime of Petrifaction, and thereby of being guilty of cauſing the Stone, Gout, and Jaundice, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons inclinable thereto; and for want of due order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> in danger thereof.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:58653:75"/>
            <p> As to the firſt, (he ſaith) it conſiſts of three Ingredients, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Nitroaluminous Salt; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Raments of Stone; and laſtly, the Glebe of Alom; all which coincide with what we aſſert as the Principles thereof, as may be further ſeen, both in our <hi>Hydrol. Chym.</hi> and in this its Vindication; ſave that what he calls the Glebe, or blew Clay of Alom, I have deſcribed as the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Minera</hi> of Iron.</p>
            <p>Which difficulty will be eaſily taken away by ſolving this Query, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Whether indeed thoſe Particles incloſed in that Alom Glebe, be not Iron, <hi>in ſucco ſoluto,</hi> or <hi>in minimis particulis,</hi> Atomes, or at leaſt ſomewhat equivalent thereto, bearing an analogical proportion of texture of parts to each other; which will not be a little facilitated, if we conſider, that as in the Vegetable Family, not only Galls will ſtrike a purple tincture with the Alom Salt (got before the addition Kelp and Urine) diſſolv'd in diſtilled, or freſh Spring-Water, but alſo the ſame may be done by other bodies, whoſe texture of parts are congeneal; as for example, the inner Bark of the Oak, the Roots of Tormentile, Avens, Biſtort, Clove-gilly flowers, and the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers called <hi>Balauſtia;</hi> all which, like Galls, will ſtrike a purple with Water wherein the Alom Salt is diſſolved; yea, and will alſo become clear again by the inſtilling a few drops of Oil of Vitriol, and with the Oil of Tartar, will become turbid and muddied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So in like manner, in the Mineral Family, are found ſeveral Stones, even in that heap which is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len off the <hi>Scarbrough</hi> Bank; which would, with Water acidulated with Oil of Sulphur, (as upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi> could not preciſely be determined to be either Alom Glebe, or Iron Stone, (though both would do it) but were ſuch as conſiſted of ſimilar parts with both.</p>
            <p>The tincture from the Galls in <hi>Scarbrough</hi> Water, he ſaith, is from unburnt Alom-ſtone: which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we grant, yet I ſee no reaſon why my ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Friend ſhould conclude, that what is precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated without the addition of Galls, ſhould not be any thing of Chalybs, or the <hi>Minera</hi> of Iron; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his two Reaſons, the firſt of which is, becauſe the Vitrioline Spirit and Iron are too great Friends (being once met together) to be ſo eaſily ſeparated; any that hath (ſaith he) prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Vitriolum Martis</hi> hath learned.</p>
            <p>Why? what difficulty is there in their ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? ſeeing the Ocre, as well in Acid as <hi>Nitro-alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Spaws,</hi> doth ſo eaſily precipitate, either by being expoſed to the Air, (witneſs the yellow Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Fountain-head of all ſuch <hi>Spaws</hi>) or by heat, (as for inſtance) any of theſe Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being heated, boyled, or diſtilled, will precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their hidden Ocre; yea, the Solution of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol of Iron, or of any common Vitriol will in heat (as I have found by tryal) do the ſame; or laſtly, by motion, <hi>ab extra,</hi> whereby alſo a precipition of the ſame mineral body happens.</p>
            <p>His ſecond reaſon is, When the Vitrioline Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by paſſing in the open Air, doth ſettle its Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar at the bottom, without any mixture of Galls, it is alwayes of a yellow colour; which is alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in my Return to the firſt Reaſon: for the Sediment of all <hi>Spaws,</hi> whether Vitrioline from Sowes, or aluminous, are alwayes yellow; witneſs
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58653:76"/>both that at <hi>Scarbrough,</hi> and that in <hi>Branſdals, Knarsbrough,</hi> and the Spring that runs through an Alom-Work near the <hi>Sulphur-Well</hi> at <hi>Knarsbrough,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>His laſt Argument againſt any thing of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora</hi> of Iron in the <hi>Spaw,</hi> is, That whereas in the taking all Chalybeat Medicines, the Excrements are tinged black; but by drinking this Water, he ſaith, they become blew; to which I anſwer, That blew, or purple, is black in a remiſs degree; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which difference, the crudity of the <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> may probably not a little contribute. But had I now the opportunity of proſecuting one Experiment, I queſtion not but to put the matter beyond diſpute; I will now onely propound it, and (as I have lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) ſhall afterwards try it, and that is this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> To take a good quantity of the ſucculent Alom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> diſſolve as much thereof, as will, in a competent quantity of freſh Spring Water, when (for tryal ſake) it will tinge with Galls readily; pour it off clear, or filter it, let it ſtand in open Glaſſes, or glaſed earthen Baſons, when it hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated what it will of a Sediment, which will be done in two or three dayes time; then pour off the Water gently, and dry it up ſlowly by the heat of the Sun, and compare that and the yellow Ocre precipitated from Vitrioline Waters together, and that either with a Microſcope, or melt them down ſeverally with a blaſt, to try if the reſult of both will not be the ſame.</p>
            <p>His proportions of the Ingredients are thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Stone-pouder one ounce three dragms, of <hi>Nitro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aluminous</hi> Salt one ounce ſix dragms, of the blew Clay, which is (as he ſuppoſeth) the Glebe of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58653:76"/>Alom three dragms; the active Principles, and the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> are equal.</p>
            <p>He Queries hence, from what cauſe it is, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have drunk a month of the Water, then, if not before, it takes a reſty fit, will neither go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or backward; upon which my Antagoniſt adviſeth, <hi>p.</hi> 211. that if the Appetite or Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on decay, and the Water paſs not ſo well as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, but cauſe diſtention either in the Belly or Veins, and ſo bring on a difficulty of breathing, or pain in the Head, or the like, it is then time (he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth) to deſiſt and proceed no further.</p>
            <p>Is there not therefore, ſaith Dr. <hi>T.</hi> a ſting in the tail of <hi>Scarbrough</hi> Water? Is not the Stone <hi>Feces</hi> plaiſtered upon the inner coat of the Bowels, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing their periſtaltick motion, and obſtructing the attraction of the lacteal Veins.</p>
            <p>His concluſion therefore is, That <hi>Scarbrough</hi>-Water is petrifying; which he endeavours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm with four Reaſons?</p>
            <p>Firſt, By Authority, as that of <hi>Kircher, Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur quid propriè ſit ſuccus lapidificus dico, eſſe ſax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um introrſum aquâ eliquatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, By Experiment, in that the <hi>Spaw</hi> is moſtly a nitrous Stone, melted in Water, beſides the Alom ſtone imbibed in it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By the <hi>Apporrheâ Spiritûs Lapidiſici;</hi> there are found on the Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ff near the <hi>Spaw,</hi> Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle-ſhels, and ſuch like things, petrified.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By the effects the <hi>Spaw</hi> produceth primarily on thoſe inclinable to the Stone; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth himſelf, and my Antagoniſt acknowledgeth it, <hi>p.</hi> 150. concerning which the Reader may pleaſe to conſult what I have ſaid in the <hi>Epilogue</hi> of my
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58653:77"/>
               <hi>Hydrol. Chym. p.</hi> 360, 361, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in effect amounts to little leſs then a concurrence with this ingenious Phyſitians Obſervations.</p>
            <p>As to the difference betwixt <hi>Scarbrough</hi> and <hi>Knarsbrough Spaws</hi> in this particular of the petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying property, he urgeth the inſtance of Mr. <hi>Hen. Proctor</hi> of <hi>Fernly,</hi> who was brought very low with a Hectick Feaver, and Aſthma, who by drinking of <hi>Knarsbrough</hi> Water, (after a due preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his body by Dr. <hi>N.</hi>) coughed up ſeveral Stones daily, till he was perfectly cured: the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which he had from Dr. <hi>N.</hi> By what is premiſed it appears, that as the one Water layes a ſtony Foundation for a Fabrick of Sabulous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, to ſuch as take the Water incautiouſly, and without circumſpection of the Nature and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of their Diſeaſes, by the advice of a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Phyſitian: So the other Water of <hi>Knarsbrough,</hi> being devoyd of all thoſe ſtony Concretions, and indued with a deopilative, and (if I may ſo ſay) antipetrifick property, is more proper for ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons inclinable to ſuch Diſeaſes, unleſs diligent care be taken, by the advice of the Phyſitian, to remove, and at due ſeaſons, carry off thoſe ſabulous products.</p>
            <p>And as the Stone, ſo the Jaundice, and the Gout (ſaith he) hath their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from a petrifying Spirit; he inſtanceth the Lord <hi>Erwin</hi>'s caſe, who dyed of the Jaundice, whereby (as he ſuppoſeth) the <hi>Scarbrough</hi> Water did petrifie the Sulphur-Saline humour in the <hi>Veſicâ Biliariâ</hi> into Stones, too great to paſs through the common <hi>ductus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this Lord did die of the Jaundice, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther probably with a complication of ſome other
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58653:77"/>Diſeaſes, might be true; but that the liquid Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Juyce of the Gaul was petrified, was but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjectural, although (I confeſs) the conjecture is not irrational, but may give ſome ground of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, and that becauſe (as he further ſaith) that Stones are as uſually concreted in the Gaul, as in the Kidneys, in Men as well as in Beaſts; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he citeth the Profeſſor at a Phyſick Lecture, in a diſcovery of the Jaundice, who brought forth three or four little Stones of the Gaul, ſeparated from a Gentlewoman (afflicted with that Diſeaſe) by a Doſe of ſharp working Phyſick, by which ſhe was cured: Which he further confirms by the opinion of <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Silvius, (viz.)</hi> That the ſecond fermentation made by the <hi>Succus Pancreaticus,</hi> and the Gaul, is as neceſſary for the preſervation of life, as the firſt fermentation in the Stomach; for according to the eucraſy &amp; fluidneſs, or the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (I mean obſtructions in the Veſſels) of this bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick ferment of the Gaul, depends not onely the Regiment of the ſecond digeſtion, and the fluidneſs and obdurateneſs of the Excrements, within the peculiar periſtaltick <hi>conatus</hi> of the Inteſtines, but alſo of all the Diſeaſes thence reſulting, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Jaundice, Diarrhaeas, Dyſenteries, Cholick, Iliack Paſſions, Tenaſmus, &amp;c.</hi> in as much as, by its <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuro-ſaline</hi> Balſam, it doth not only (in a regular courſe of Nature) become as a ferment to prepare the ſaline milky Juyce, before it be conveighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the lacteal Veſſels; but alſo it promotes a ſeparation by a kind of precipitation of the faecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the nutritive Juyce; in which precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the moſt exuberant and untamed ſulphurous parts of the alimentary Juyce, firſt opened and prepared by the ſtomachial ferment, go off in a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58653:78"/>ſaetid Flatus, peculiar to the Inteſtines, (which is that which <hi>Helmont</hi> otherwiſe calls a Stercorary Ferment) and that it is ſo, appears hence, becauſe the poſterior <hi>flatus</hi> or <hi>crepitus,</hi> will take flame of a Candle, and blaze like an Occidental Meteor; the obſtruction, and conſequently the regurgitation of which <hi>flatus</hi> upon the ſtomach, and other parts, cauſeth many diſturbances of Nature, which now I ſhall not take time to diſcourſe upon.</p>
            <p>So that indeed, amongſt the efficient cauſes of the Jaundice, a petrification of part of that Juyce, or a plaiſtering the inteſtines over with a tartarous or ſandy matter, where the <hi>ductus communis</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, may moſt frequently happen; whereby this <hi>Sulphuro-ſaline</hi> Juyce, deſtined for uſes aforeſaid, may prepoſterouſly be carried <hi>(extra lares pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prios)</hi> into the Maſs of Blood, or rather indeed the blood, not undergoing that due ſeparation by the ferment of the Gaul, from cauſes aforeſaid, retains yet in its boſom that which ſhould be ſeparated; which circulating along with it in the habit of the body, vitiates the laſt ferment, or aſſimulative dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whereby the skin becomes tinged yellow, and ſhines forth in a Saffron colour.</p>
            <p>That the Water may ſometimes happen (through the incautiouſneſs of the Patient) to cauſe this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; my ingenious Friend inſtanceth in the caſe of an Alderman of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and a Merchants Wife, who after their return from the <hi>Scarbrough Spaw,</hi> were both afflicted with the Jaundice; as alſo Sir. <hi>John Anderſon</hi> and his Lady, who both drinking the Water at home, were afterwards troubled with the Jaundice; all which might indeed very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably happen to theſe, who without due caution had dranke liberally of the <hi>Scarbrough</hi> Water,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58653:78"/>and that either at two great a diſtance from the Fountain, or did not at leaſt uſe ſuch skilful means, as at due ſeaſons might carry off the gritty ſabulous reſidence of the Water; concerning which ere long we ſhall preſcribe a Remedy.</p>
            <p>That the Gout alſo may be promoted by the <hi>Scarbrough</hi> Water, (ariſing from a petrifying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of its acid Spirit) he inſtanceth in himſelf, who never had the leaſt touch thereof, before he drank that Water; the which alſo my Antagoniſt acknowledgeth, <hi>p.</hi> 149. Others (ſaith he) drinking without due preparation, as was neceſſary, have fallen into the Gout, the Water contracting heat for want of ſpeedy paſſage, being thrown by nature upon the weak Joynts, and have hence inferred, that theſe Waters cauſe the Gout.</p>
            <p>That the drinking of this Water may to ſome Patients, at ſome times, occaſionally cauſe the Gout, through the debilitude of the ſeparating Emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, carrying the ſabulous matter along with the nutritive Juyce, through the Lacteal, into the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Atterial Veſſels, in the <hi>liquamen</hi> of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi> where, in the habit of the body, this ſabulous matter may be precipitated into a <hi>tophus</hi>-like, or <hi>nodus</hi>-kind of petrifaction, in the <hi>Synovia</hi> of the Joynts, tranſmitting along with it a ſpurious acid Ferment, hoſtile to thoſe tender parts: I ſhall not (I ſay) deny, if we together take into our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration other concomitant, and perhaps no leſs eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial circumſtances, of irregularity in Diet, ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hardneſs of Drink, in Exerciſe and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of the Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we find often ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient alone to bring on that Diſeaſe, yea, and to exaſperate it in a high meaſure to thoſe who never drank of this or any other <hi>Spaw</hi> Water; yea, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58653:79"/>that to many too, upon whoſe ſeminal Principles the morbid Character of the Gout was never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall proceed firſt, to examine the reaſon he gives why the <hi>Scarbrough</hi> Water is not of ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying a nature as the <hi>Knarsbrough</hi> dropping Well, (which he ſuppoſeth to come from a nitrous Rock) and next I ſhall preſcribe a Remedy how to prevent petrifaction, and alſo how to carry off what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready contracted; where I ſhall anſwer (I hope to the Patients ſatisfaction) his three Ingredients.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, the Reaſon he gives is this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Alkali of the Alom in <hi>Scarbrough</hi> Water, hath in part imbibed the acidity of the Nitre, and therefore it cannot ſo penetrate the Wood put in it, as to leave a Cruſt of Stone upon it, which the other Water having (as he ſaith) Nitre alone, will do; And here I muſt crave pardon, if for truths ſake I diſſent from my ingenious Friend; for the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of his reaſon is laid upon a wrong ſuppoſition, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Salt of Alom is an <hi>Alkali,</hi> whereas in the current of my whole diſcourſe upon this <hi>Spaw,</hi> I have laid it down as an acid Salt, which are ſo contrary, as they are never reconciled (upon their mutual contact) till each deſtroy other, and a third neutral reſult therefrom. The ground of his Reaſon, why he reputes Alom to contain an <hi>Alkali,</hi> is from its ſaponary property. That Alom (ſaith he) is an <hi>Alkali,</hi> is plain from its ſaponary property, for the Dyers ſcour their Cloth from all filth, by boyling it in Alom Water; which is no leſs then a palpable miſtake, for the Dyers uſe it not for ſcouring their Cloth, but for laying a ground for other Colours; as for inſtance, If three pieces of Cloth be put into the Dyers Woad or Glaſtum,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58653:79"/>one White, another Yellow, the third Red; the White, without any previous preparation by Alom, ſhall be Blew; the Yellow, by being firſt a few hours in Alom-Water, ſhall be Green; and the Red, by being alſo boyled in Alom-Water, ſhall be Tauny. So that if they ſhould generally uſe Alom Water for ſcouring their Cloth, they would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be prevented either of making Yellows or Blacks; to both which, Alom makes Cloth incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore they onely uſe it in order to a Ground, fitting it to take other colours afterwards; it wholly deſtroys all Blacks, yea, it is ſo far from being lixivial, as it leaves a harſhneſs upon Cloth, whereby it's made capable of ſtriking other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
            <p>Now that Alom conſiſts chiefly of an acid Salt, is further evident by mixing a lixivium of Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, or of any Vegetable fixt Salt, which the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſimple Alom Salt, the mixture preſently coagulates or curdles into a white Gelly; whereas if it was of the ſame nature, they would mix, as Spirit of Vitriol with Spirit of Vitriol, <hi>Lixivium</hi> with <hi>Lixivium,</hi> Water with Water, like with like.</p>
            <p>Beſides, he is incautious of what he elſewhere aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, <hi>viz.</hi> where he ſaith, That the <hi>Scarbrough</hi>-Water curdles Milk, not by any Vitriol, but by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom; Who Queſtions (ſaith he) that Alom will curdle Milk as well as Vitriol? the more ſubtil any acid Liquor, put to the Milk is, the more perfectly doth it ſeparate the thick parts from the thin; here he acknowledgeth the Alom to conſiſt of an acid Juyce, which is quite contrary to a Lixivial, for what the one makes, the other deſtroys.</p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:58653:80"/>
            <p> Now that the <hi>Alkali</hi> of the Alom ſhould imbibe the acidity of Nitre; this latter aſſertion is no more true then the former: for as the Alom contains no <hi>Alkali,</hi> ſo neither the Nitre, as Nitre, any acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for if you put a little Nitre into boyled Milk, it will coagulate it no more, then if ſo much Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil Salt was put in, neither of which two Salts are acid, until by force of fire in cloſe Veſſels; they are brought over in a fluid form, <hi>in ſtatu Fluoris;</hi> in cloſe Veſſels, (I ſaid) becauſe in open Veſſels, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre will by force of fire, with a little addition of Sulphur, or Charcoal, become an <hi>Alkali</hi> or fixt Salt; which is quite contrary to its acid Spirit, got by diſtillation; yea, that it is not acid, is further e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, in that it will cauſe no ebullition with a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> which all acids certainly do: So that hence we may certainly conclude, firſt, That the acidity of Nitre is not a cauſe of petrifaction; and that's evident, becauſe it hath no acidity, till it be raiſed by the fire; next, That the cauſe of petrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the <hi>Scarbrough Spaw,</hi> (compared with <hi>Knarsbrough</hi> dropping Well) is not to be computed from an imbibition of the acidity of Nitre, by the <hi>Alkali</hi> of Alom, neither of which, as ſuch, are <hi>in rerum naturâ:</hi> So that (notwithſtanding all this) we are yet to caſt about for the finding out a more probable cauſe of petrifaction. In order to which, I would firſt inquire, How many ſorts of Mineral Waters will coagulate Milk? and amongſt them, which are the moſt likely to contribute to petrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
            <p>All Waters therefore which coagulate Milk, are either ſuch as are ſtrongly Vitrioline; witneſs the <hi>German Spaws,</hi> or ſuch as are aluminous; as for inſtance, <hi>Scarbrough, Epſham,</hi> the <hi>Sulphur-Well</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:58653:80"/>at <hi>Knarsbrough,</hi> (which hath an occult aluminous acidity therein contained) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or laſtly, Such as contain a <hi>Saxum Nitroſum,</hi> or Raments of Stone with a nitrous Juyce, which becomes as a Cement, and knits the ſabulous matter (where the place and other circumſtances concur) into ſtony Concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; of this ſort is the dropping or petrifying Well at <hi>Knarsbrough,</hi> alſo at <hi>Bruncton</hi> near <hi>Northaller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and in many places more, which will coagulate Milk, and in evaporation leave Raments of a bright nitrous Stone.</p>
            <p>Now the ſubject matter of all ſtony Concretions, are either a ſabulous Earth, glewed together by the efficiency of a ſalty Liquor, either of Alom, Nitre, Salt Foſſil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eaſily coagulable by a ſpontaneous exiccation of the ſucculent parts, by being long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Air, or elſe it conſiſts in a peculiar pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying ſeminal Juyce, implanted in ſtony Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, whereby they have their growth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
            <p>Thus all the Rocks in the Sea, have had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and growth, from a petrifying Seed, which hath tranſmuted the <hi>Lympha,</hi> or common ſubject matter of all concrete bodies, into ſuch ſtony Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, <hi>Calx in Mediis Aquis ſenſim petreſcit:</hi> Thus Coral, White and Red, by an innate petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Seed, ſprings out of Rocks, and other Stones in the Sea, which grow from the very ſame Juyce, the Stone (it vegetates from) had its nouriſhment; only it is determined into that form, by the imbred plaſtick power of that ſtony Plant, and becomes like (if I may ſo ſay) a Miſletoe of the Rock; Yea, and from one or both cauſes aforeſaid, hath (for ought we know) all the rocky and ſtony pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions in the bowels of the Earth, had their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
            <pb n="144" facs="tcp:58653:81"/>
            <p> But to be ſhort, Petrifaction, as to the <hi>Duelech,</hi> or <hi>Calculus humanus,</hi> (the ſubject we chiefly now have in hand) I ſee no reaſon to the contrary, but look upon it as chiefly ſeminaly; elſe how comes it, that little Children are ſometimes grievouſly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with fits, and die of the Stone; As I have ſeen a young Child, after death, opened, whoſe Reins contained one large Stones, beſides divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſer ones; by which it ſhould appear, that the <hi>inclinatio petrifica,</hi> which is the ſame with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying Seed, was at firſt impreſſed upon the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of its conſtitution; and in ſuch, where the petrifying Seed is at work, the nutritive Juyce can never be ſo pure, nor the Steinors or Colanders of the Veſſels be ſo accurate in their functions, but the Stone and Gravel will be increaſed, the Spirit of Urine will coagulate it ſelf upon its innate Earth, and ſo cauſe a concretion of a ſabulous matter; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though much more from ſome ſorts of Meats and Drinks, then from others; amongſt ordinary Drinks, Ale that is hard, blenk'd, or new, thick and unwrought, or Wine which is not depurated from its Tartar by due fermentation, are very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſomenters of the Stone; ſo is Bread not well baked, Meat not well cooked and prepared; and in fine, what ever contributes to the Fabrick of the nutritive Juyce, when through the weakneſs or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the ferments, reluctancy of that which is taken, or injuſtice of the diſtributive powers, a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent tartarous or ſabulous matter is ſequeſtred, and either thrown upon the Veſſels, or tranſmitted by the current of the <hi>Latex,</hi> into other more fine Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers and Streinors of the Body.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Stone, Gout, Jaundice, Diarrhaeas, Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteries, Feavers; &amp;c.</hi> are in time brought forth,

            <p>Therefore reſpect muſt primarily be had to the <hi>inclinatio petrifica &amp; podagrica,</hi> or natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Stone or Gout; for to ſuch, not only the Waters which contain a ſabulous matter, but alſo the common nutritive Juyce made from our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary food, may ſingly or conjoyntly bring forth, or elſe exaſperate the fits of the Stone, Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the ſabulous matter of the Waters, as well as the tartarous recrements of our food, being imbibed by the <hi>Latex</hi> of the Blood, doth (the one as well as the other) by its various filtratures and percola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, leave its precipitate upon the Streinors, Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and Membranous Parts, cauſing the foreſaid Diſeaſes in Bodies inclinable thereunto.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> Method Preſcribed For the right uſe of the <hi>Scarbiough-Water.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>NOW come I to give my Receipt how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent petrifaction, by propounding a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for the right uſe and improvement of the Water; where, firſt, I adviſe all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, who would take this Water for their beſt advantage and help, for the prevention or cure of the <hi>Stone, Gout, Scurvy, Jaundice, Palſies, Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Aſthma,</hi> or other chronical Diſeaſes; to begin with a gentle Vitrioline Vomit, the Doſe to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered according to the diſcretion of the adviſing Phyſitian, which may be done, although the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hath for ſome time drunk of the Water; for this ſort of Vonrit (which is ſurely the ſafeſt in the World) doth not onely carry off plenty of a depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved matter, involved in the Tunicles of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the fomenter of moſt Diſeaſes, whether Acute or Chronical, but alſo ſtrengthens the Fibres of the Stomach, and other Membranes, through the whole body, reducing them to their proper Tone; which the generality of Solutions, yea, the too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of this <hi>Spaw</hi> Water, is apt to relax, and to make them flag and hang; the depravation of whoſe oeconomy, makes them forgetful of their offices, and renders them ſuſceptible of a ſtony in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruſtation,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58653:83"/>from the ſabulum of the Water; and hereby they become the cauſe of all thoſe Diſeaſes, which happen upon thoſe who incautiouſly drink, and that long and plentifully of this <hi>Spaw</hi> Water: and hence it is, that after a months drinking of the Water, it ſometimes happens that the Appetite or Concoction decayes, (which my Antagoniſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know ledgeth) or the Waters paſs not ſo well, but cauſe diſtention in the Belly or Veins, and ſo brings on a difficulty of breathing, pain in the head, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>All which may be now remedyed, by the method we are now propounding; for this kind of Vomit (which may, as occaſion ſhall require, be ſafely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated) doth fortifie the membranous parts notably, and makes them mindful of their duties; after which the Patient may, for two or three mornings, drink pretty freely of the Waters, uſing moderate exerciſe after, as walking upon the Sands, or in their Chamber; and about two hours after the laſt Glaſs of Water, let them drink a Glaſs or two of the beſt White Wine, (well refined from its Tartar) and about one hour after that, take ſome warm Broth; then to eat of a few Diſhes of Meat, and thoſe to be as well ordered as may be: nor is it a little reſpect that is to be had to the Drink at Meats, viz. that it neither be new, thick, or unwrought, nor that it be hard or tart.</p>
            <p>So that four things are to be regarded in the drinking of the Waters.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Moderate exerciſe after drinking the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To drink a Glaſs or two of Wine, two hours after the Water, to help the paſſage thereof.</p>
            <pb n="149" facs="tcp:58653:83"/>
            <p> Thirdly, Not to eat too ſoon after the Waters; for either by too immoderat exerciſe, that which ſhould paſs away by Urine, (by the ſhort way) is prepoſterouſly carried into the habit of the body, or by eating too ſuddenly before the Waters have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; the like diſorder may happen, (viz.) That the Latax wherein the ſabulous matter is diſſolved, is thereby in danger to be carried by the Thoracical Veſſels, into the fourth digeſtion of the heart, and thence into the habit of the body, where it may lay a foundation for the Gout, Stone, Scurvy, Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, A moderation in Dyet, having good Meat well ordered, and to keep a reſtraint upon the Stomach, not overcharging it with too much, nor with too great variety of food, for ſometimes what the Water builds, in order to health, the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity of dyet in ſome perſons pulls down.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Good wholſome Drink is to be choſen at Meats, which ſhould neither be very ſmall, nor hard or tart, nor, laſtly, new, thick, or unwrought, but ſhould be ſoft, clear, and healing Ale; or a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſort of Beer, freſh and lively; all botled Ale (eſpecially that which flies) is to be avoided; in ſhort, it ſhould be kindly Ale, ſuch as may well dilute our other ſolid Food, and be a ſutable Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of our nutritive Juyce; for from a due contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of our Drink and Meat (by the efficiency of the ferments) ariſeth the wholſomneſs of our nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</p>
            <p>When the Patient hath drank for two or three dayes of the <hi>Spaw</hi> Water, after the former directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then is he to take a Doſe of Solutive Pills, <hi>viz.</hi> one over-night, and two the next morning; obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58653:84"/>much what the former inſtructions, and to omit taking any Water for that day.</p>
            <p>Theſe Pills ought to be ſo contrived by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, as to contain in them ſuch Ingredients as may chiefly reſpect the Scurvy, and that becauſe the Scurvy is moſt-what the ground to other Diſeaſes; and next, that they may be ſuch as may give the Patient four or five ſtools, (without griping) as his ſtrength, and the indications of his Diſeaſe may require; not neglecting, in the interim, other ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks ſeaſonably to be exhibited, as the Phyſitian ſhall think meet, from the indications of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
            <p>Then (if the Phyſitian think fit) is the Patient to reſt a day or two from taking the <hi>Spaw</hi>-Water, and that to prevent a ſudden precipitation of the ſtony matter upon the Tunicles of the Inteſtines, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their abſterſion or cleanſing by the former Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and after that to begin again, obſerving the former inſtructions, and ſo on in a round, with ſuch diverſifications as the Phyſitian, from a critical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Symptoms and Indications, ſhall judge requiſite, until the Patient be cured, at leaſt in ſo hopeful a way towards it, as that Nature may, without much ſtreſs, tug through the reſt.</p>
            <p>And by this means, will all the inconveniencies which happen, as afore-ſaid, to incautious <hi>Spaw</hi>-Drinkers, be prevented; hereby Patients will not miſs of their aim, <hi>viz.</hi> their deſired health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This courſe being taken, I ſee no cauſe of ſuſpition of any harm from the Waters; for ſuppoſing (at the worſt) a precipitation ſhould happen, which cannot be much; the next Doſe of Antiſcorbutick Pills, together with a good Diuretick, and a glaſs or
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58653:84"/>two of Wine, will abſterge it off, and carry it c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> verly away.</p>
            <p>Nor need we be altogether ſo fearful of harm from the ſtony Concretions in the Water, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider, That Phyſicians often preſcribe Coral, Crabs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyes, Pearl, Crabs-claws, Hyacinth, Smaragde, Saphire, Bezoar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Ingredients of ſeveral compound Species, as of <hi>Pulv. è chel. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crorum, ſpecies Cordiales, &amp;c.</hi> frequently ordered by them for the cure of Diſeaſes; which ſometimes dulcifie the Blood, and other eſſential Juyces of the body, by coagulating their acidities, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cauſe obſtructions in the bowels, and give be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to Apoſtemations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being frequently carried off by Siedge.</p>
            <p>Yea, I know a Gentlewoman, who being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a ſpurious (and therefore ſuperfluous) acidity upon her Stomach, amongſt the hundred of Remedies ſhe hath uſed, finds nothing comparable to the eating plenty of Chalk, which is a ſtony Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: This more powerfully, then any other thing ſhe has yet met with, dints the overflowing acidity, ſweetens it, which otherwiſe, with an acid <hi>flatus,</hi> afflicts her Inteſtines, cauſing unufual <hi>tormina,</hi> or griping of the Guts; Of this ſhe has eaten (as I remember ſhe told me) ſome pecks in ſome late years, and yet is no more afflicted with the Stone or Gout, then ſhe was before the taking thereof.</p>
            <p>So that all thoſe who are not originally inclined to the Stone or Gout, may very ſafely drink of the Waters, and that with very good ſucceſs, for the cure of moſt other inflrmities, by the due manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> according to our preſcribed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, where we are not ſo magiſterial in our advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but do leave the judicious Phyſitian to vary, as
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58653:85"/>he ſeeth cauſe, I giving only hints, and opening a Caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for more light, for the better diſcovery of the improvement of this Noble <hi>Spaw,</hi> in order to the cure of many Diſeaſes; for Art is not only to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Nature, but alſo help and ſupply its deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſeparating what is ſuperfluous, and adding what is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>But if any, who are inclined originally to the Stone or Gout, ſhall upon the conſideration that the <hi>Scarbrough</hi>-Water is ſo eſurine or acid, by its imbibed Nitro-aluminous, or duplicate Salt, as to diſſolve and carry along in its bowels the ſeveral Raiments of Stone, ſhall, I ſay, thereupon become jealous of drinking the Water:</p>
            <p>To thoſe I ſhall firſt adviſe, the drinking the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter according to our preſcribed Method; which if it do not anſwer their expectation upon tryal, at leaſt doth not ſatisfie, then would I thus farther add, <hi>viz.</hi> That doubtleſs when theſe ſtony Concretions are ſeparated by Art or Nature, the foreſaid Salt being diſſolved in freſh Water, (which upon evaporation yeelds no ſabulous Sediment) muſt needs, I ſay, become very powerful againſt all thoſe Diſeaſes, whoſe ſeminaries conſiſt in a ſabulous petrifying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as the Stone, Gout, Jaundice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially if diſſolved with the addition of Salt of Steel, and drunk with great plenty of Spring-Water ſo acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</p>
            <p>And therefore, laſtly, would I propound to all thoſe who are afflicted with theſe Diſeaſes, upon not being ſatsfied with the former Method, or being at too great a diſtance, to take it accordingly, either (by procuring this duplicate Salt of the <hi>Spaw</hi>) to diſſolve it in ſome pure Spring Water, as aforeſaid, with the addition of Salt of Steel, and ſo to drink
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58653:85"/>it (according to the adviſe of their Phyſitians) at home; or elſe, to diſſolve the ſame Salt in ſome Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioline Water, as that of <hi>Kuarsbrough, Rotheram, Olton, &amp;c.</hi> and to drink as large quantities thereof, as their Phyſitian, by the indications of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, ſhall adviſe.</p>
            <p>Thus, from what is premiſed, the three Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (propounded by my candid Friend) for the right improvement of the Water, are readily, and without much ado, anſwered: for, firſt, by a right management of the Waters, according to our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, the ſuſpitious petrifying property of the <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi> Waters may very probably be prevented, yea and though already begun, may as likely be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off; And, ſecondly, by the ſame proceſs, the Stone-pouder, and faeces of the Alom, may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from fixing upon the Bowels; and, laſtly, to prevent (in tender conſtitutions) that the duplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Salt corrode not the Entrals, may eaſily be done, either by our former Method, or by diluting the eſſential Salt thereof in great plenty of freſh Spring Water, or by diſſolving it in Vitrioline <hi>Spaws,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>

            <head>An APPENDIX Concerning the Anatomy of the <hi>GERMAN Spaw-Water.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Took about a quart of the <hi>Spaw-Water,</hi> (which is brought out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and expoſed to ſale in <hi>Leiden, Amſterdam,</hi> and other Cities of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> in Bottles ſealed up) into a little of which I put ſome Pouder of Galls, with which it ſtruck a pale Clarret colour; the reſt I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be put into a Glaſs Retort, with a clean Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver cloſe luted to it, and gave an eaſie heat, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling off firſt about one ounce of Water, then poured it ſorth, and found that it had neither taſte, ſmell, nor any other properties that might diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from ordinary Spring-Water diſtilled, for with Galls it would make no more alteration then common diſtilled Water: Then we diſtilled off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two or three ounces more of inſipid Water; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, I ordered the fire to be permitted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh, to try what kind of precipitate it would let fall; becauſe, after the firſt ounce was come over, ſlacking the fire, we found that a little Sediment was fallen, which was of a pale reddiſh colour; and upon the ſecond cooling, more of the ſame fell down: Then I cauſed that which remained in the Retort to be filtred, and ſav'd the Sediment in the Filter Paper; which being dryed up, was an inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid pale red Calx.</p>
            <pb n="155" facs="tcp:58653:86"/>
            <p> Then I tryed if the filtred Water, after this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, would give any tincture with Galls, as it did before ſeparation, but found it would not; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I poured it into the clean waſhed Retort, and diſtilled again, as before, until all was come off, except about one half ounce: This I brought to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and evaporated in a clean Jar Glaſs, in a gentle heat, till it came to a dryneſs. The colour of this Pouder was ſomewhat white, and its taſte was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly ſharp or piercing, with a heat and warmth diffuſed upon the Tongue, but had no Vitrioline taſte: to this, pouring Oil of Sulphur <hi>per campanam,</hi> it did make a manifeſt ebullition, as if it had been poured upon ſo much Salt of Tartar; but Oil of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> did cauſe no efferveſcence at all; by which it was evident, that the Salt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this reſidence, was rather lixivial then acid, although in taſte it ſcem'd to be neutral, but to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of both; ſo that probably this Spring in its Original (I mean where it is firſt impregnated with Mineral Juyces) is hot, but running further through a Colander of Earth or Sand, loſeth its heat, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes at its eruption a cold Spring.</p>

            <p>AND here, that I may entertain the Reader with ſome little variety, I ſhall end all with ſome Obſervations on the diſſection of an antient Woman, who dyed at the Hoſpital in <hi>Leyden,</hi> of the Yellow Jaundice; Her Skin (before death, as well as after) was dyed the moſt deep Yellow that ever I ſaw in my life; ſhe conſumed away in a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> not withſtanding all the means that could be uſed, and it will be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impoſſible that it ſhould otherwiſe be, after I have related what we obſerved in the diſſection of her body: Upon the opening of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> of this <hi>Cadaver,</hi> (perform'd by the Profeſſor in the Theatre) was firſt obſerv'd (omitting the leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable enormities) a connexure or knitting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> and the under part of the left Lobe of the Liver, cloſe by the <hi>Veſica Bilaris,</hi> by a hard ſchirrhous tumour; for beſides that, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach was ſomewhat larger then ordinary, and the Spleen lay length wayes, in a parallel line with the direct Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> being ſomewhat leſs then uſual; and although being cut, its <hi>Patenchyma</hi> was found of a due conſiſtence, and not vitiated in ſubſtance; I ſay, beſides theſe, the Liver was found very ſtiff and hard, with ſeveral ſchirrous tumours, ſome leſſer, ſome bigger, whoſe conſiſtence was moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what glandulous, one or two being as big as Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, and ſome leſs, but one near as large as a Man's Fiſt.</p>

               </gap> like little Peas, ſome larger, but all of them moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what angular; in colour ſome near bright, and not much unlike the ordinary ſort of Mother of Pearl; others had dark ſpots intermingled, and, as it were, marbled: The Profeſſor diſtributed to each of the Students, who were preſent, one of theſe Stones as a rarity. The liquid part of the Gaul, which was not yet petrified, moſt of which was lodged in the <hi>Ductus Hepaticus,</hi> was tenacious, and moſtwhat of the conſiſtence of a Syrup.</p>
            <p>The common <hi>Ductus,</hi> which reacheth from the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> to the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> was ſo much obſtructed, as the Profeſſor could not (without cutting the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel which leads from the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> further open) make the Style paſs from that part into the Inteſtine; and that becauſe the ſituation of the parts was altered, and become different from the natural, by reaſon of that ſtrict connection of the <hi>Pylorus</hi> with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>Then opening the <hi>Thorax,</hi> the Lungs were found ſcarce vitiated at all, but the Heart was leſs by much then uſual; yea, and that which was the wonder of the whole, (and which no Author (that we know of) has yet ever obſerved) was, to ſee a <hi>Schirrus</hi> upon the right Ventricle of the Heart. True, the <hi>Polypus Cordis</hi> has been frequently found in the diſſection of <hi>Dutch</hi> Bodies, by the ſam'd <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I ſaw another Woman diſſected there, who dyed (as was ſuppoſed) of a <hi>Syncope;</hi> in the right Ventricle of whoſe heart was found a <hi>Polypus,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inches long, from the Baſis to the Cone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58653:88"/>although it's more probable ſhe dyed of a complication of other Diſeaſes; for in the <hi>Abdomen</hi> was found a great quantity of a <hi>Serum,</hi> together with plenty of a <hi>Pituita</hi> floating together in that cavity. But that there ſhould be a ſchirrous tumor upon the Heart, is what we never heard of, or at leaſt never obſerved before.</p>
            <p>As to the cauſe of the Jaundice in this Woman, it was variouſly diſputed; ſome ſuppoſed that it proceeded onely from an obſtruction of the Bile, which thereby being mixed with the Blood, was diſperſed into the whole habit of the Body: Others ſuppoſed that the Diſeaſe proceeded ſrom a volatili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Bile, which paſſing up by the <hi>Ductus He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paticus,</hi> was thence, by the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> ſent into the Maſs of Blood, and ſo vitiated the whole habit of the Body with that Saffron Dye: But upon the diſſection, it ſhould ſeem to be evident that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Craſis of the Bile was wholly perverted, and that that which ſhould have been uſeful in its due conſiſtence, not only as a Balſam to the Blood, but alſo by its volatile <hi>Alkali,</hi> to perform the gentle and natural fermentation in the Inteſtines, together with the ſubacid ferment of the Pancreatical Juyce, was in great part (being vitiated in its conſtituent parts) petrified; which petrifaction, as well in that as in other parts of the body, do all, moſt probably, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſame efficient cauſes; and that (not unlikely) from a too great exaltation of the ſaline and ſulphureous parts of the Bile, coagulating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon ſome terreſtrial or tartarous matter, which, by continuance of time, hath been precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to the bottom or ſides of the <hi>Veſica Bilis.</hi>
